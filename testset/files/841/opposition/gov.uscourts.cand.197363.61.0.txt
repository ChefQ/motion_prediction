SUMMARY OF OPPOSITION

1
2

Defendant Legacy Support Services’s (“Legacy”) motion to “set aside any

3

appearance of default” is not ripe for review. No default has been entered yet and

4

cannot be entered until the Court grants the partial lift of stay requested by Plaintiff

5

(to which Legacy claims opposition). In fact, Legacy’s motion was filed in violation

6

of the stay entered in this case (Docket # 39).

7
8

Furthermore, even if default had been entered (as it should), there are no
grounds to excuse Legacy for its default.

9

ADDITIONAL FACTS

10
11

Legacy never appeared in this case in any shape or form until April 30, 2008

12

by co-filing an Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial Lift of Stay. Kramer

13

Decl. ¶ 4. Even as of this filing, Legacy has not filed or offered for filing an Answer

14

or other responsive pleading to the Amended Complaint due to be answered no later

15

than January 14, 2008.

16

The Order upon which Legacy claims it is entitled to rely was drafted by

17

Defendant DNNA (compare Document # 27 proposed order with Document # 33

18

signed order) and explicitly defines “Defendant” in the Order as “Digital Networks

19

North America, Inc.” Request for Judicial Notice of Document Nos. 27 and 33.

20

There has been no suggestion, formal or informal, written or oral, prior to the

21

filing of Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial Lift of Stay that Legacy was represented by the

22

same lawyers as DNNA or that any appearance or filings by DNNA were intended to

23

have been made by Legacy. Kramer Decl. ¶ 5 and Request for Judicial Notice of

24

entire court file in this case.

25

Defense counsel, Mr. Rohde, has misstated Ms. Kramer’s position on this

26

matter by referencing her letter dated April 16th and Mr. Rohde’s response letter, but

27

not including Ms. Kramer’s April 21st letter in which she corrected Mr. Rohde’s

28

misstatements as follows. See Kramer Decl. ¶ 6 and Exhibit A.

I am in receipt of your [Mr. Rohde’s] letter dated today. Apparently
you did not read my letter closely. It is not my contention that the Court
made an error in its order, except to the extent that it did not correct a
typographical error in the proposed order that DNNA sent to the Court.
Document # 33 is unambiguous in its identification of the “Defendant”
as Digital Networks North America, Inc. and none other. See the first
sentence. You simply cannot make a good faith argument that the
typographical errors should be construed in favor of a defendant who
made no appearance, but is currently represented by the same counsel as
the party who drafted the order.

Furthermore, although you claim that Legacy relied on DNNA’s
typographical errors in that Order, there is no legitimate basis for that
claim. The only way that argument would make sense was if your
office was secretly representing Legacy in every document that it filed
which explicitly and repeatedly represented itself as representing
DNNA and only DNNA. I could not even find any reference to Legacy
being noticed on any of DNNA’s motions.
On the day of our phone conversation, I gave you the benefit of the
doubt that you had just overlooked the specific context in which the
Order in question was issued. It is now clear that you are, in fact, trying
to make arguments that are unsupported by fact or law.
Let me again be clear. I consider it to be a Rule 11 violation for you to
make an argument to the Court that contradicts every single written and
oral representation, formal and informal, previously made to us and the
Court regarding who your office represented and upon whose behalf
arguments were made. If your office had any intention for DNNA’s
motions for extension, motion for stay, or resulting orders to accrue to
the benefit of Legacy, you were grossly misrepresenting your intent at
the time both to Plaintiff and to the Court.

24
25

I will expect you and your colleagues to drop this frivolous argument.

ARGUMENT

1
2

4

LEGACY’S MOTION IS NOT RIPE FOR REVIEW BECAUSE PLAINTIFF
HAS NOT YET OBTAINED PERMISSION FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT
AGAINST LEGACY DUE TO THE LITIGATION STAY.

5

“The court may set aside an entry of default for good cause, and it may set

6

aside a default judgment under Rule 60(b).” Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 55. However, there

7

is no legal basis for “setting aside an appearance of default” as Legacy requests the

8

Court to do.

3

I.

9

Plaintiff has pending a Motion for Partial Lift of Stay set for hearing on the

10

same day as this motion. Until that Motion is granted, no further evaluation of the

11

merits of Plaintiff’s request for default nor Legacy’s arguments against it should be

12

reviewed. However, upon grant of that motion, Plaintiff is absolutely entitled to

13

entry of default. Legacy has neither answered, attempted to answer, or requested

14

permission to answer, the Amended Complaint.
In the meantime, however, there is no legally cognizable relief for a “motion

15
16

to set aside any appearance of default.”

PLAINTIFF IS ENTITLED TO ENTRY OF DEFAULT AGAINST
LEGACY.
“When a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought has

failed to plead or otherwise defend, and that failure is shown by affidavit or
otherwise, the clerk must enter the party's default.”

Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 55(a)

(emphasis).
The docket sheet in this case shows that although Legacy was required to file
an answer or responsive pleading to the Amended Complaint on or before January
14, 2008, it did not file such a response. The only impediment to the entry of default
was the entry of stay of this case issued after Legacy defaulted.

1

Legacy did not seek an extension of time to file such a response, nor did it

2

reasonably rely on anything in the court file to suggest that they did not have to

3

answer. Furthermore, although their default has now been brought to Legacy’s

4

attention, it has neither filed an answer, attempted to file an answer, nor requested

5

leave to file an answer. Legacy has not even claimed an inability to file an answer

6

due to the stay issuing after it fell into default. To the contrary, it has violated the

7

stay by filing a motion for affirmative relief “from an appearance of default” without

8

even promising to file an answer.
Defendant Legacy is in default and will not be entitled to relief from default

after it is properly entered as set forth below.

III.

LEGACY WOULD NOT BE ENTITLED TO THE SETTING ASIDE OF
DEFAULT IF SUCH A MOTION WERE PROPERLY BROUGHT.
Legacy has turned proper motion procedure on its head by asking this Court to

“set aside any appearance for default” before Plaintiff has had the opportunity to
request the entry of default (Plaintiff’s motion for partial lift of stay for that purpose
is pending), before a default has been entered, and while simultaneously objecting to
a partial lift of stay to allow for entry of default. Legacy’s position is procedurally
problematic.
Because Legacy’s improperly filed motion is pending, Plaintiff is hereby
responding to the arguments in Legacy’s motion as though it were a motion to set
aside entry of default and using the proper standards of review for such a motion.
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(c) provides that a court may set aside a
default for “good cause shown.” In the Ninth Circuit, the “good cause” standard that
governs setting aside a default under Rule 55(c) is the same standard that governs
vacating a default judgment under Rule 60(b).

Franchise Holding II, LLC v.

Huntington Restaurants Group, Inc., 375 F.3d 922, 925 (9th Cir. 2004). The “good
cause” analysis involves consideration of three factors:

(1)

whether Legacy engaged in culpable conduct that led to the default;

2

(2)

whether Legacy has a meritorious defense; or

3

(3)

whether reopening the default would prejudice Plaintiff.

4

See Franchise Holding II, 375 F.3d at 925-26. These factors are disjunctive and,

5

thus, a district court may refuse to set aside a default if any of the three factors are

6

true. Id. at 926.

7

Legacy’s default (though not yet formally entered) should not be excused or

8

set aside because Legacy has neither established the existence of a meritorious

9

defense, nor shown good cause for its failure to answer the Amended Complaint.

10
11
12

A.

Legacy has not established the existence of a meritorious defense;
general denials and conclusory statements of the existence of a
meritorious defense are insufficient to set aside a default.

13
14

The movant for an order vacating entry of default must show specific facts

15

which would establish that the asserted defense has some probability of success on

16

the merits. See Franchise Holding II, 375 F.3d at 925-26; Cohen v. Murphey, 222

17

F.R.D. 416, 418 (S.D.Cal. 2004); Robinson v. Bantam Books, Inc., 49 F.R.D. 139,

18

140-41 (S.D.N.Y. 1970). In Cohen, even though the defendants filed answers after

19

entry of default, the court refused to set aside the default where the defendants had

20

offered no facts to support their defense. Cohen, 222 F.R.D. at 418. “Defendants

21

have not offered points and authorities, declarations, or other supporting documents

22

that would permit the court to assess the probability of a meritorious defense.” Id.

23

Concern underlying the requirement that a party moving to set aside a default must

24

show the existence of a meritorious defense is to determine whether there is some

25

possibility that the suit will have an outcome different from the result achieved by

26

default. Hawaii Carpenters’ Trust Funds v. Stone, 794 F.2d 508, 513 (9th Cir. 1986).

27

A defendant who claimed only that he would present a meritorious defense at

28

some unidentified future date “failed to present ‘even a hint of a suggestion’ that he

possessed a meritorious defense” and thus was not entitled to have a default against

2

him set aside. Mercer v. Jaffe, Snider, Raitt and Heuer, P.C., 730 F.Supp. 74, 79

3

(W.D.Mich. 1990), aff’d 933 F.2d 1008 (6th Cir. 1991).

4

It is not enough to offer conclusory statements that a dispute exists. “A mere

5

general denial without facts to support it is not enough to justify vacating a default or

6

default judgment.” Franchise Holding II, 375 F.3d at 926 (citing Madsen v. Bumb,

7

419 F.2d 4, 6 (9th Cir. 1969)). Thus, general denials or conclusory statements that a

8

meritorious defense exist are insufficient to set aside default. See e.g., Consolidated

9

Masonry & Fireproofing, Inc. v. Wagman Const. Corp., 383 F.2d 249 (4th Cir. 1967)

10

(proper for trial court to require defendant to state underlying facts); Nelson v.

11

Coleman Co., 41 F.R.D. 7 (D.S.C. 1966); U.S. v. One Lot or Parcel of Land, in City

12

of Austin, Being Lot 2 Block D of Woods of Westlake, 838 F.Supp. 318 (E.D.Tex.

13

1993) (mere conclusory assertion of meritorious defense insufficient); Directv, Inc.

14

v. Rosenberg, 2004 WL 345523 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (conclusory denial did not amount

15

to meritorious defense); Mike Rosen & Associates, P.C. v. Omega Builders, Ltd., 940

16

F.Supp. 115 (E.D.Pa. 1996) (general denial of “originality” of author’s architectural

17

work not meritorious defense in determining whether to set aside default in copyright

18

infringement case); Maine Nat. Bank v. F/V Cecily B. (O.N. 677261), 116 F.R.D. 66

19

(D.Me. 1987); Chandler Leasing Corp. v. UCC, Inc., 91 F.R.D. 81 (N.D.Ill. 1981)

20

(movant must present a factual basis for its claim of meritorious defense); Cohen v.

21

Murphey, 222 F.R.D. 416 (N.D.Cal. 2004) (failure to demonstrate potentially

22

meritorious defense where neither answers nor motion to set aside default contained

23

any facts supporting the defense).

24

Legacy has not met its burden of showing that it has a meritorious defense.

25

Legacy has neither filed, nor offered to file an answer. The only support for its claim

26

of the existence of a meritorious defense consists of an assertion in its brief that the

patent-in-suit is invalid 1 buttressed by the fact of the patent undergoing

2

reexamination by the PTO. That unsupported claim does not begin to demonstrate

3

the existence of a meritorious defense because the patent is presumptively valid and

does it establish a likelihood of patent invalidity.

[T]he grant by the examiner of a request for reexamination is not
probative of unpatentability. The grant of a request for reexamination,
although surely evidence that the criterion for reexamination has been
met (i.e., that a “substantial new question of patentability” has been
raised, 35 U.S.C. § 303), does not establish a likelihood of patent
invalidity.FN2See Acoustical Design, Inc. v. Control Elecs. Co., 932 F.2d
939, 942, 18 USPQ2d 1707, 1710 (Fed.Cir.) (“initial rejection by the
Patent and Trademark Office of original claims that later were
confirmed on reexamination hardly justifies a good faith belief in the
invalidity of the claims”), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 863, 112 S.Ct. 185, 116
L.Ed.2d 146 (1991).

14

FN2. The Annual Report of the Patent and Trademark Office for
1994 states that 89% of the reexamination requests were granted
that year, but only 5.6% of the reexamined patents were
completely rejected with no claims remaining after
reexamination.

Hoechst Celanese Corp. v. BP Chemical Ltd., 78 F.3d 1575, 1584 (Fed. Cir. 1996).

20

The criteria for the USPTO to accept a request for reexamination is not high.

21
22
23
24
25

A prior art patent or printed publication raises a substantial question of
patentability where there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable
examiner would consider the prior art patent or printed publication
important in deciding whether or not the claim is patentable. . . . It is
not necessary that a “prima facie” case of unpatentability exist as to
the claim in order for a “substantial new question of patentability”
to be present as to the claim. Thus, “a substantial new question of

obvious in view of, the prior art patents or printed publications. . . .

It is easy to get the USPTO to reexamine a patent. The USPTO’s “Ex Parte

Reexamination Filing Data – March 31, 2008” report reflects 92% of ex parte

reexamination requests are granted. However, the same report shows that only 10%

8

of reexaminations result in cancellation of all claims. Kramer Decl. ¶ 7, Exhibit B.

B.

Legacy has not shown good cause for its failure to answer the Amended
Complaint when required.

11

“If a defendant ‘has received actual or constructive notice of the filing of the

12

action and failed to answer,’ its conduct is culpable.” Franchise Holding II, 375

13

F.3d at 926 (quoting Direct Mail Specialists, Inc. v. Eclat Computerized Techs., Inc.,

14

840 F.2d 685, 690 (9th Cir. 1988).

15

The district court in Franchise Holding II found that, due to the high stakes

16

involved (defendant had defaulted on its restaurant business loans), defendant’s

17

failure to seek an extension of time to respond to the complaint was evidence of

18

culpable conduct. Defendant disputed this, asserting that the parties had reached a

19

side agreement to extend filing deadlines while the parties were in negotiations.

20

Plaintiff denied that any such agreement ever existed. The Ninth Circuit found

21

defendant culpable for the entry of default even if such a side agreement had existed.

22

The agreement allegedly stated that plaintiff would not pursue litigation while

23

negotiations were continuing in good faith.

24

informed defendant via letter that negotiations had broken down and that it was

25

proceeding with litigation. Regardless, defendant failed to file anything until after

26

plaintiff began collecting on the default judgment, and then defendant only filed a

27

motion to set aside entry of default and default judgment. Franchise Holding II, 375

28

F.3d at 926.
8.

Plaintiff, however, had explicitly

1

The Ninth Circuit then likewise held that defendant had not established

2

excusable neglect based on similar reasons supporting its conclusions regarding

3

culpability. “The entry of default and the default judgment were squarely within

4

[defendant’s] control. [Defendant] received actual notice of both the action and

5

[plaintiff’s] intent to pursue it. [Defendant] nevertheless failed to file an extension of

6

anything else with the district court until [plaintiff] began to collect on the default

7

judgment.” Franchise Holding II, 375 F.3d at 927.

8

In Hunt v. King, the court found that the defendant's failure to answer the

9

complaint “was willful and demonstrated a flagrant disregard for the authority of the

10

court,” permitting the district court to refuse to set aside entry of default on good

11

cause grounds. Hunt v. Kling Motor Co., 841 F.Supp. 1098, 1106 (D.Kan. 1993),

12

aff’d 65 F.3d 178 (10th Cir. 1995). In Hunt, there was no evidence demonstrating

13

that the defendant did not have actual knowledge of the complaint, the summons

14

explicitly stated that failure to answer within 20 days would result in entry of default

15

judgment, and the defendant never filed an answer or otherwise pled to the plaintiff's

16

complaint. Id.

17

In this case, there is no evidence demonstrating that Legacy did not have

18

actual knowledge and receipt of the Amended Complaint and the accompanying

19

summons providing that failure to answer within 20 days would result in entry of

20

default judgment. The entry of default has been squarely within Legacy’s control.

21

Legacy never filed an answer or otherwise pled to the Amended Complaint and does

22

not, even now that its default has been brought to the attention of the Court, offer to

23

file an answer.

Legacy and/or Its Attorneys Engaged In Culpable Conduct That
Led To Legacy’s Default.

Legacy’s claimed excuse for not filing an answer is a mere self-serving
attorney statement that Legacy relied on an order that its alleged counsel at the time

drafted. That order makes no reference whatsoever to Legacy. It unambiguously

2

defines the term “Defendant” as DNNA, and then uses the term “Defendant,” in its

3

singular form, throughout the order, with the exception of two places where the

4

defined term “Defendant” is made plural by adding an “s.” Legacy “hangs its hat”

5

on these two occasions that had an “s.” If this is the best that Legacy can offer as an

6

explanation for its failure to respond to the complaint, Legacy needs to find a

7

different hat. Legacy’s reliance is directly contradictory to the explicit wording and

8

context of that order. Mr. Rohde’s statement that both he and Legacy “relied on the

9

plain language of the Order” in determining not to answer is a weak excuse, at best.

10

The true measure of a court order is not an isolated phrase appearing therein,

11

but its effect when considered as a whole, and the same rules of interpretation apply

12

as in ascertaining the meaning of any other writing. Roraback v. Roraback, 101 P.2d

13

772, 774 (Cal.App. 3 Dist. 1940); Concerned Citizens Coalition of Stockton v. City

14

of Stockton, 26 Cal.Rptr.3d 735, 739 (Cal.App.3.Dist. 2005); Western Greyhound

15

Lines v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County, 331 P.2d 793, 795 (Cal.App. 1958).

16

“The proper construction of a court's decree is not to be obtained by seizing upon

17

isolated parts of the decree; rather it is to be determined by an examination of the

18

issues made and intended to be submitted and what the decree was really designed to

19

accomplish. Its scope is to be determined by what preceded it and what it was

20

intended to execute.” N.L.R.B. v. Edward G. Budd Mfg. Co., 169 F.2d 571, 575 (6th

21

Cir. 1948); see also Hendrie v. Lowmaster, 152 F.2d 83, 85 (6th Cir. 1946) (“Where a

22

judgment is susceptible of two interpretations, it is the duty of the court to adopt that

23

one which renders it more reasonable, effective and conclusive in the light of the

24

facts and the law of the case.”); Talman v. Talman, 39 Cal.Rptr. 863, 866

25

(Cal.App.2.Dist. 1964). If the language of a court order is uncertain, reference may

26

be had to circumstances surrounding, and the court's intention in making, the order.

(Cal.App.3.Dist. 2005). “In construing an order, resort may be had to the notice of

2

motion.” Western Greyhound Lines v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County, 331

3

P.2d 793, 795 (Cal.App. 1958).

4

The Order (Document # 33) begins with the following statement of definition

5

– “Defendant DIGITAL NETWORKS NORTH AMERICA, INC. (“Defendant”) has

6

moved . . . to enlarge time . . .” (Document # 33, page 2:1). This is consistent with

7

Document # 28, the motion to which it referred, which refers to the moving party as

8

DNNA at least 13 times and never refers to Legacy (see Document # 28,

9

throughout). This is also consistent with the motion’s declaration (Document # 29)

10

which refers to DNNA no fewer than 15 times, and never refers to Legacy.

11

After the initial definition, the Order again refers to a singular “Defendant” or

12

the singular possessive “Defendant’s” at lines 4, 5, 6, and 8. It is only at lines 11 and

13

12 that it switches to “Defendants’ ” and “Defendants,” a meaningless plural in light

14

of the context of a motion filed by only one party. There is nothing in the notice of

15

motion, motion, accompanying paperwork, or other parts of the proposed order that

16

in any way mention Legacy.

17
18

The only logical interpretation of that Order is that it was intended to cover
DNNA and only DNNA. Legacy had no part of it.

19

If Plaintiff had drafted the order, perhaps Legacy would have a colorable

20

argument. That is not the case. Instead, Legacy is trying to sell the Court on the

21

story that when its alleged counsel at the time referred to DNNA, and only DNNA,

22

in page after page of the motion, declaration, and proposed order, and in every single

23

aspect of pleading from identification of party representation to substantive

24

argument, that Legacy’s alleged counsel at the time actually meant both DNNA and

25

Legacy.

26

There is no evidence before the Court from any officer or employee of Legacy

27

as to Legacy’s belief or reliance. Mr. Rohde’s statement is the height of self-serving

28

unreliability and cannot be made the evidentiary basis for Legacy’s requested relief.

1

If Legacy wanted a delay in filing its answer, it should have filed such a

2

request along with DNNA. It did not do so. If Legacy desired a stay of the

3

litigation, it should have requested one or joined DNNA’s request. It did not. There

4

is no colorable reason to believe that Legacy relied on the Order that it now claims to

5

have relied on.

6

There is no evidence that Legacy “relied” upon the two inconsistent plural

7

forms of the term “Defendant.” There is only a declaration of Legacy’s counsel who

8

drafted the Order with the inconsistent language and context. Glaringly absent is

9

evidence from Legacy itself that it contacted Mr. Rohde at the beginning of this

10

lawsuit and requested that he represent Legacy and, as with DNNA, request an

11

extension of time for Legacy to respond to the complaint. In seeking to “set aside

12

the appearance of default,” Legacy should have offered far more than its counsel’s

13

declaration, which, in its best light, offers an excuse of questionable credibility.

C.

Legacy’s disregard for the obligations of a party to respond to a
complaint prejudices Plaintiff.

Legacy was properly served with a summons and amended complaint and
obviously made an affirmative decision to not defend. It did not file a timely answer,
did not request an extension of time to respond, and did not request a stay pending
reexamination. It did nothing. Thus, Plaintiff is entitled to an entry of default.
Plaintiff will be prejudiced if it is not allowed to receive the benefit of a
default when the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure dictate Plaintiff’s entitlement. If
Legacy believes that the default is improper, it would have the right to present a
properly supported motion for that purpose. However, as demonstrated above, it has
no entitlement to forgiveness of its default. It has not shown any good excuse for
failing to comply with the answer deadline and fails to show a meritorious defense.
Plaintiff is required to abide by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; so must the
Defendants, including Legacy.

1

Even now, when its default has been brought to the attention of the Court,

2

Legacy has not offered to Answer the Amended Complaint. Rather, it merely sets

3

forth a frivolous argument claiming reliance on an out-of-context “s” that its

4

attorneys full well know do not make the Order applicable to Legacy, and violated

5

the existing stay by filing a motion for relief without leave of Court.

6

Allowing Legacy to escape the known and natural consequences of failing to

7

answer the Amended Complaint – a default – and allowing Legacy to turn back the

8

clock and be in the same position it would have been had it not defaulted, without

9

requiring that Legacy meet the legal standards for setting aside a default, is

10

prejudicial to Plaintiff and makes Rule 55 meaningless.

11

CONCLUSION

12
13

Legacy’s motion to “set aside any appearance of default” is not ripe for review

14

until Plaintiff is allowed to have entry of default (to which is it entitled) which is

15

predicated on Plaintiff’s co-pending motion for partial lift of stay for entry of default

16

(to which Legacy claims opposition). In fact, Legacy’s motion was filed in violation

17

of the stay entered in this case (Docket # 39).

18

Even if the Court slogs past the stay violation and other procedural problems

19

with this motion, Legacy is definitively in default and would not be entitled to relief

20

from default anyway.

21

meritorious defense, nor demonstrated good cause for its failure to file an answer

22

when due. Requiring that only Plaintiff follow the procedural rules of court, and not

23

also expecting the same behavior from Defendants, is unfair and prejudicial to

24

Plaintiff.

Legacy has neither demonstrated the existence of a
