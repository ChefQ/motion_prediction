TO ALL PARTIES AND THEIR COUNSEL OF RECORD:

2

NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that on June 13, 2008 at 9:00 a.m., or as soon thereafter

3

as the matter may be heard by the above-entitled Court, defendant Legacy Support Services, Ltd.

(“Legacy”) will and hereby does respectfully move for the Court to grant an Order setting aside

Under the plain language of the Court’s December 18, 2007 Order Granting Defendant’s
Motion Pursuant to Civil L.R. 6-3 To Enlarge Time To Respond To The Amended Complaint

10

Pending Motion to Stay, Docket #33, Legacy is not in default. Further, should the Court find an

11

appearance of default, Legacy submits it can show good cause as to why any entry of default or

12

finding of default should be set aside. Legacy has not engaged in any culpable conduct leading

13

to an appearance of default and Legacy has a meritorious defense to the underlying litigation

14

claims. Further, Plaintiff Sorensen will not be hindered in his ability to pursue a claim in this

15

litigation, and thus will not be prejudiced.
