PLAINTIFF'S RESPONSE TO DISTICT OF COLUMBIA'S MOTION
FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGEMENT

Plaintiff, Trayon White, by and through undersigned counsel, hereby responds to the
Districts motion for partial summary judgment for the District of Columbia as to Plaintiff's 0x00A7
1983 claim (Claim 1 of the Amended Complaint). The Plaintiff concedes that it may not be able
to demonstrate 0x00A7 1983 claim against the District of Columbia. The Plaintiff notes that he may not
be able to show that The District of Columbia had explicit policies that motivated the
unprovoked battery by DC police officer Amos against Mr. White or that the District was so
indifferent to a pattern of pervasive Constitutional abuse that it amounted to a tactical
endorsement. However, the District of Columbia is liable for the actions of its officers under the
doctrine of respondeat superior. Am. Compl. yen 42.

Therefore, consistent with Monell v. Dept. of Soc. Serv of City of New York, 436 U.S.
658,690 (1978), it is appropriate that Plaintiff concede, as appropriate, the District's Motion for
Partial Summary Judgment on Claim 1 of the Amended Complaint against the District of
Columbia.

Dated: February 27, 2017
