DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA’S
MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Defendant District of Columbia (“the District”), by and through undersigned counsel,
pursuant to Fed. Civ. R. P. 56(a), moves this Court for summary judgment as to Plaintiff’s §1983
claim (Claim I of the Amended Complaint). As will be explained in greater detail in the
attached memorandum of points and authorities, the District is entitled to summary judgment
because the District cannot be held liable for a §1983 constitutional violation solely under a
theory of respondeat superior. And Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that the District had explicit
policies that would have motivated the alleged unprovoked battery, or that the District was so
indifferent to a pattern of pervasive Constitutional abuse that it amounted to a tacit endorsement.
Consequently, no reasonable jury could find for Plaintiff on his constitutional claim and the
Court should grant judgment to the District on Count I of the Amended Complaint.
Dated: February 3, 2017
Respectfully submitted,
KARL A. RACINE
Attorney General for the
District of Columbia

MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA’S MOTION
FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT

INTRODUCTION
The District is entitled to partial summary judgment because the District cannot be held
liable for a §1983 Constitutional violation solely under a theory of respondeat superior. The
District of Columbia can only be held liable if the Constitutional violations were the result of
express District legislation or policies, or if the District’s inaction or indifference rose to a level
such that they were, in effect, policies of the District. The Plaintiff can demonstrate neither of
these two requirements that are necessary to hold the District liable for a §1983 constitutional
violation.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
Summary judgment is warranted when the “materials in the record, including depositions,
documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations, ...
admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials” show “there is no genuine dispute as to
any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a)(c). “The mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties” will not defeat
1

Case 1:14-cv-00723-CKK Document 52 Filed 02/03/17 Page 4 of 11

summary judgment; “the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact.”
Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986). “A fact is ‘material’ if a dispute
over it might affect the outcome of a suit under the governing law; factual disputes that are
‘irrelevant or unnecessary’ do not affect the summary judgment determination.” Holcomb v.
Powell, 433 F.3d 889, 895 (D.D.C. 2006) (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248)). An issue is
“genuine” if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving
party. Id. The genuineness of an issue may also be called into question if a prior judgment
precludes the current action. See Morgan v. F.A.A., 657 F. Supp. 2d 146, 152-53 (D.D.C. 2009)
(“A decision to grant summary judgment… requires a determination of whether there is a
genuine issue of fact as to whether a prior judgment exists and precludes this action.”).
“[T]he burden on a defendant moving for summary judgment may be discharged without
factual disproof of the plaintiff's case; the defendant need only identify the ways in which the
plaintiff has failed to come forward with sufficient evidence to support a reasonable jury to find
in her favor on one or more essential elements of her claim.” Grimes v. Dist. of Columbia, 794
F.3d 83, 93 (D.C. Cir. 2015). But, the non-moving party's opposition “must consist of more
than mere unsupported allegations or denials and must be supported by affidavits, declarations or
other competent evidence, setting forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for
trial.” Brown v. Broadcasting Bd. of Governors, 662 F. Supp. 2d 41, 46 (D.D.C. 2009) (citing
Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e)); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324 (1986). The non-moving party
must “provide evidence that would permit a reasonable jury to find” in his favor. Laningham v.
U.S. Navy, 813 F.2d 1236, 1242 (D.C. Cir. 1987). If the non-movant's evidence is “merely
colorable” or “not significantly probative,” summary judgment may be granted. Anderson, 477
U.S. at 249-50; see Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007) (“Where the record taken as a

2

Case 1:14-cv-00723-CKK Document 52 Filed 02/03/17 Page 5 of 11

whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is ‘no genuine
issue for trial.’”) (quoting Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S.
574, 587 (1986)). To defeat summary judgment, a Plaintiff must have more than “a scintilla of
evidence to support his claims.” Freedman v. MCI Telecomms. Corp., 255 F.3d 840, 845 (D.C.
Cir. 2001).
ARGUMENT
I.

The District Cannot Be Held Liable Under a §1983 Claim Solely on a Theory of
Respondeat Superior.
According to Plaintiff “Defendant District of Columbia is liable for the actions of its
officers under the doctrine of respondeat superior.” Am. Compl. ¶42 This is not sufficient to
find against the District for a constitutional violation under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 based on the the
injuries allegedly caused by Defendant Amos .
Municipal liability under 42 U.S.C. 1983 is severely limited. The Supreme Court, in
Monell v. Dept. of Soc. Serv. of City of New York, 436 U.S. 658, 690 (1978), expressly restricted
municipal liability to cases where “the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or
executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation or decision officially adopted and promulgated
by that body’s officers.” The District acknowledges that as a municipality, it is a “person” for
purposes of § 1983.
However, as a municipality, “[the District] can be found liable under § 1983 only where
[it] causes the constitutional violation at issue.” Id.; see also Best v. District of Columbia, 743 F.
Supp. 44, 46 (D.D.C.1990); City of Canton, Ohio v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 385 (1989) (citing
Monell, 436 U.S. at 694-95). Conversely, “a municipality cannot be held liable solely because it
employs a tortfeasor—or, in other words, a municipality cannot be held liable under § 1983 on a
3

Case 1:14-cv-00723-CKK Document 52 Filed 02/03/17 Page 6 of 11

respondeat superior theory.” Monell 436 U.S. at 690. As a result, a municipality cannot be sued
under § 1983 simply because one of its employees or agents violated a plaintiff's rights. Id.
Here, to the extent that Plaintiff seeks to hold the District liable for a violation of Plaintiff’s
Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights based upon a theory of respondeat superior liability,
the District is entitled to summary judgment.
II.

Plaintiff Cannot Demonstrate That His Injuries Resulted From An Explicit Policy of
the District of Columbia.
As discussed above, a municipality’s liability for constitutional violations is restricted to
where a deliberate choice to follow a course of action is made from among various alternatives
by city policymakers. City of Canton, 489 U.S. at 389. This requirement ensures that a
municipality is held liable only for those deprivations resulting from the decisions of its duly
constituted legislative body or of those officials whose acts may fairly be said to be those of the
municipality. See Board of County Com'rs of Bryan County v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 403-04
(1997). Thus, a plaintiff must establish municipal liability by showing that “the municipality or
one of its policymakers explicitly adopted the policy that was ‘the moving force of the
constitutional violation.’ “ Warren v. District of Columbia 353 F.3d 36, 39 (D.C. Cir. 2004)
(quoting Monell, 436 U.S. at 694).
Plaintiff cannot show that the actions of Defendant Amos were birthed “from the
decisions of [the District’s] duly constituted legislative body or of those officials whose acts may
fairly be said to be those of the municipality.” Board of County Com’rs of Bryan County, 520
U.S. at 403-04. Nothing in the record supports the notion that the District of Columbia, or the
Metropolitan Police Department, has any sort of formal policy that would have directed
Defendant Amos to smash a car trunk onto the Plaintiff’s head without provocation or prior

4

Case 1:14-cv-00723-CKK Document 52 Filed 02/03/17 Page 7 of 11

confrontation, as plaintiff alleges. The Amended Complaint does not even attempt to allege that
the District of Columbia possessed some sort of custom or policy that would have directed
Defendant Amos to smash a car trunk onto the Plaintiff’s head. See generally Am. Compl.
Consequently, Plaintiff cannot proceed against the District on Count I under a custom or policy
theory.
III.

Plaintiff Cannot Demonstrate That the District’s Inaction Amounted to a Decision to
Violate the Constitution.
Although the “deliberate-indifference” standard provides the opportunity to argue that the

District’s inaction amounts to a decision to violate the Constitution, nothing in the record
supports such indifference here. City of Canton, Ohio v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, at 394-95 (1989)
(O’Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“a claim of municipal liability is
predicated upon a failure to act, the requisite degree of fault must be shown by proof of a
background of events and circumstances which establish that the ‘policy of inaction’ is the
functional equivalent of a decision by the city itself to violate the Constitution.”); see also
Warren, 353 F.3d at 39 (Deliberate indifference “involves more than mere negligence. It does
not require the city to take reasonable care to discover and prevent constitutional violations. It
simply means that, faced with actual or constructive knowledge that its agents will probably
violate constitutional rights, the city may not adopt a policy of inaction.”). The pattern of
indifference must be comprised of similar constitutional violations affecting the plaintiff and
other persons. See Martin v. Malhoyt, 830 F.2d 237, 255 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (“One instance,
however egregious, does not a pattern or practice make.”); McClendon v. City of Columbia, 258
F.3d 432, 442 (5th Cir. 2001) (The pattern must reflect “similar incidents in which citizens were
injured or endangered by” unconstitutional conduct.). Each violation must be a “concentrated,

5

Case 1:14-cv-00723-CKK Document 52 Filed 02/03/17 Page 8 of 11

fully packed, precisely delineated scenario.” Parker v. District of Columbia, 850 F.2d 708 712
(D.C. Cir. 1988) (emphasis added); see Cox v. District of Columbia, 821 F. Supp. 1, 13 (D.D.C.
1993) (noting that the Supreme Court ratified the D.C. Circuit’s Parker decision in City of
Canton). The violations must not be scattered or isolated. Instead, they must “line up to
compose a common or widespread pattern.” Carter v. District of Columbia, 795 F.2d 116,
123−24 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (emphasis added). Thus, a plaintiff must show that policymakers knew
of and tacitly authorized a pattern of similar constitutional violations by non-policymaking
employees. City of Canton, 489 U.S. at 397 (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in
part).
Plaintiff cannot point to - nor alleges - any pattern of repeated incidents to which the
District was deliberately indifferent that support of municipal liability here. See generally Am.
Compl. No documents in the record indicate that the District of Columbia knew of and tacitly
authorized a pattern of unprovoked assaults by officers against other persons. The Plaintiff, thus,
cannot rely on a theory of the District’s inaction to attach §1983 liability to the District.
Because Plaintiff ’s theory of liability rests solely on the doctrine of respondeat superior,
and because he cannot proffer any evidence that the District maintained policies promoting the
unprovoked battery of civilians, and because Plaintiff cannot demonstrate pervasive deliberate
indifference to such behavior, the District of Columbia is entitled to summary judgment on
Count I of the Amended Complaint .
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the District of Columbia is entitled to summary judgment in its
favor on Count I of the Amended Complaint.

STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS NOT IN DISPUTE
1. Nothing in the record supports the notion that the District of Columbia, or the
Metropolitan Police Department, contain any sort of formal policy that would have
directed Defendant Amos to smash a car trunk onto the Plaintiff’s head without
provocation or prior confrontation, as plaintiff alleges.
2. Plaintiff’s own Amended Complaint does not attempt to allege that the District of
Columbia possessed some sort of custom or policy that would have directed Defendant
Amos to smash a car trunk onto the Plaintiff’s head. See generally Pl. Am. Compl.
3. Plaintiff cannot point to - nor alleges - any pattern of repeated, deliberate indifference
that would allow him to argue for the imposition of municipal liability against the District
of Columbia. See generally Pl. Am. Compl.
4. No documents in the record indicate that the District of Columbia knew of and tacitly
authorized a pattern of unprovoked assaults by officers against other persons.
