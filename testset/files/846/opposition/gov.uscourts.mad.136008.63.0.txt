CRYSTAL LITZ,
and all others similarly situated,
Plaintiffs,
v.

Civil Action No. 1:11-cv-10693

THE SAINT CONSULTING
GROUP, INC., P. MICHAEL SAINT
and PATRICK FOX,
Defendants.
DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION TO FILE SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT
Defendants The Saint Consulting Group, Inc. (“TSCG”), P. Michael Saint and Patrick
Fox (collectively “Defendants”), hereby submit this opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion to File
Second Amended Complaint (“Motion to Amend”). As set forth more fully herein, Plaintiff’s
Motion to Amend must be denied because: (1) it is futile; (2) it fails to meet the prerequisites of
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) for class actions; and (3) it would unduly prejudice Defendants.
Initially, Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend is futile because she does not have standing to
bring a claim under G.L. c. 151, § 1A whereas: she did not work in Massachusetts; she is not a
Massachusetts resident; and she does not have an employment agreement which contains a
Massachusetts choice of law provision. Despite Plaintiff’s assertion to the contrary, it would be
unprecedented, improper and unconstitutional for this Court to apply G.L. c. 151, § 1A to
individuals who do not have any contacts with Massachusetts other than being employed by a
global corporation which maintains its headquarters in Massachusetts.

Case 1:11-cv-10693-GAO Document 63 Filed 06/14/11 Page 2 of 20

Moreover, Plaintiff’s proposed Second Amended Complaint fails to meet Fed. R. Civ. P.
23(a)’s prerequisites. The putative class does not meet the commonality requirement because
this Court would be required to conduct a conflict of laws analysis for each individual putative
member based upon the laws of the state where he or she actually worked. Plaintiff has also
failed to sufficiently plead Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)’s prerequisites for numerosity and adequacy of
representation. Finally, Defendants would be unduly prejudiced if Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend
were granted because her proposed amendment would transform this case into a class action
litigation which would significantly increase the resources and complexity required for their
defense. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend must be denied with prejudice.

BACKGROUND
A.

Procedural History

This action was originally filed by Leigh Mayo on September 27, 2010 in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. (Doc. 1). In Mr. Mayo’s Complaint, he
alleged individual causes of action under Illinois state law as well as a collective action claim
pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”) alleging that TSCG’s project managers were
entitled to unpaid overtime. (Id.). Crystal Litz consented to become a party plaintiff to this
action on December 17, 2010 and Amanda Payne consented to do so on January 7, 2011. (Docs.
19, 21). On March 10, 2011, Ms. Litz was substituted for Mr. Mayo as the named representative
plaintiff in this case. (Doc. 31).
On March 15, 2011, Ms. Litz filed the Amended Complaint – the complaint of record in
this action – which dropped Mr. Mayo’s individual Illinois state law claims, but maintained the
FLSA collective action claim. (Doc. 38). After the Illinois state law claims were dropped, the
instant action was transferred to this Court from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District

Case 1:11-cv-10693-GAO Document 63 Filed 06/14/11 Page 3 of 20

of Illinois in April, 2011. (Docs. 45-47). On May 13, 2011, Plaintiff filed her “Motion to File
Second Amended Complaint” which now seeks to add a Massachusetts state law class action
claim for allegedly unpaid overtime. (Doc. 52). The proposed Massachusetts state law class
action claim is based upon essentially the same allegations used to support the prior Illinois state
law claims. (Doc. 52).
B.

Factual Background1

Plaintiff and the individuals she seeks to represent were employed by Defendants as
project managers. (Plaintiff’s proposed Second Amended Complaint at ¶ 3). During the class
period, Plaintiff was not a resident of Massachusetts. (Id. at ¶ 9). Plaintiff was not employed by
Defendants in Massachusetts. (Id. at ¶ 2). Plaintiff does not allege that she or any of the putative
class members had employment agreements which contained a Massachusetts choice of law
provision. (Id. at ¶¶ 1-15). Plaintiff’s proposed Second Amended Complaint does not contain
any allegations about any of the project managers working or residing in Massachusetts. (Id.).
Since September 2007, TSCG has employed approximately 45 project managers in its offices
throughout the United States as well as its international offices. (See Affidavit of Jeffrey R.
Gould, Esq. dated June 14, 2011 (“Gould Aff.”) at ¶¶ 2-3). A majority of TSCG’s project
managers since 2007 have not worked in Massachusetts. (Id. at ¶¶ 6-7).

ARGUMENT

Legal Standard

“Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides in part that leave to amend
pleadings ‘shall be freely given when justice so requires,’ but amendment is not automatic.”

The facts contained in Plaintiff’s proposed Second Amended Complaint are deemed undisputed for the
purposes of the Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion to File Second Amended Complaint only.

15(a)). “Reasons for denying leave include … undue prejudice to the opposing party, and futility
of amendment.” U.S. ex rel. Gagne v. City of Worcester, 565 F.3d 40, 47 (1st Cir. 2009) (citing
Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)). “In determining whether the proposed amendment
to a complaint is futile, the Court must determine whether the amended complaint still fails to
state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and if it still fails, the district court acts within its
discretion in denying the motion to amend.” Brown, 2011 WL 1311278 at * 5 (citing Abraham
v. Woods Hole Oceanographic Inst., 553 F.3d 114, 117 (1st Cir. 2009); see also Adorno v.
Crowley Towing and Transportation, Co., 443 F.3d 122, 126 (1st Cir. 2006); Glassman v.
Computervision Corp., 90 F.3d 617, 623 (1st Cir. 1996).2
Furthermore, where a proposed amendment to assert a class action fails to meet the
mandatory prerequisites of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a), the Court should deny the motion to amend.
See Landgraff v. GEMB, 2007 WL 1101277, * 3 (E.D. Pa. 2007); Dong v. Board of Educ. of
Rochester Cmty. Sch., 197 F.3d 793, 804 (6th Cir. 1999); Smith v. Transworld Systems, Inc., 953
F.2d 1025, 1033 (6th Cir. 1992). These prerequisites for class certification are: “(1) the class is
so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact
common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the
claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately
protect the interests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).
B.

Plaintiff’s Motion To Amend Is Futile

Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend seeks to add a Massachusetts state law claim alleging a
failure to pay overtime compensation in violation of G.L. c. 151, § 1A despite the fact that, as
2

Whereas Ms. Litz is the only named Plaintiff in this action, if a claim is futile with respect to her, then it
cannot be maintained as a class action. See In re WellNx Marketing and Sales Practices Litigation, 673 F. Supp. 2d
43, 55 (D. Mass. 2009) (“a plaintiff who lacks standing … cannot invoke the machinery of a class action, which is a
creation not of law, but of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.”); see also Britt v. McKenney, 529 F.2d 44, 45 (1st
Cir. 1976).

4

Case 1:11-cv-10693-GAO Document 63 Filed 06/14/11 Page 5 of 20

Plaintiff cannot dispute: she did not work in Massachusetts; she was not a Massachusetts
resident; and she did not have an employment agreement with a Massachusetts choice of law
provision. Plaintiff asks this Court to reach the unprecedented and unconstitutional conclusion
that G.L. c. 151, § 1A applies to individuals across the globe who do not have any contacts with
Massachusetts other than the singular fact that they are employed by a global corporation which
maintains its headquarters in Massachusetts. This contention is meritless for several reasons.
At the outset, Chapter 151 itself expressly limits its scope to individuals employed in
Massachusetts. Chapter 151’s legislative history and courts interpreting Massachusetts’ wage
laws also dictate that it cannot be applied extraterritorially. Moreover, courts throughout the
United States have held that state wage laws cannot be applied extraterritorially. Several courts
have further recognized that an application of state wage law in the manner Plaintiff suggests
would be unconstitutional. Finally, the cases relied upon by Plaintiff are inapposite as they do
not deal with individuals like Ms. Litz who are nonresidents, working outside of Massachusetts
without an employment agreement containing a Massachusetts choice of law provision.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s proposed claim under G.L. c. 151, § 1A is not a claim for which
relief can be granted. Therefore, the Court should deny Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend with
prejudice whereas it seeks to add a claim which is futile.
i.

Chapter 151 Expressly Limits Its Scope To Employees In Massachusetts

Chapter 151 – the chapter under which Plaintiff proposes to bring her new claim –
expressly limits its scope to individuals who are employed in Massachusetts. Specifically, the
very first section of the chapter states that “[i]t is hereby declared to be against public policy for
an employer to employ any person in an occupation in this commonwealth at an oppressive and
unreasonable wage ….” G.L. c. 151, § 1 (emphasis added). Chapter 151’s limitation to

5

Case 1:11-cv-10693-GAO Document 63 Filed 06/14/11 Page 6 of 20

Massachusetts employees is further evidenced where it limits the powers of the commissioner
and attorney general to investigate the wages of persons “employed in any occupation in the
commonwealth.” G.L. c. 151, § 3(1) (emphasis added). These powers entrusted to the attorney
general are to enforce the same rights that an individual would otherwise have under Chapter
151. Thus, it is axiomatic that an individual is also only allowed to bring a claim under Chapter
151 is he or she is “employed in any occupation in the commonwealth.”
Here, the only allegation contained in Plaintiff’s proposed Second Amended Complaint
which relates to Massachusetts is that TSCG “is a Massachusetts corporation which is
headquartered in Massachusetts.” (Doc. 52-1 at ¶ 10). Plaintiff does not allege a single other
fact connecting her, any of the putative class members, any of the Defendants or any of their
alleged actions to Massachusetts. Indeed, Plaintiff and a majority of the putative class members
did not work in Massachusetts and in fact have no connection to Massachusetts other than the
fact that the global corporation they work for is headquartered in Massachusetts. Thus, Plaintiff
and a majority of the putative class members were not “employed in any occupation in the
commonwealth” and they clearly lack standing to bring a claim under Chapter 151. G.L. c. 151,
§§ 1, 3(1). Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend must be denied with prejudice whereas the
claim she proposes to add is futile.
ii.

Chapter 151 Cannot Be Applied Extraterritorially

“Massachusetts statutes ‘are presumed not to apply extraterritorially unless there is clear
legislative intent.’” Telford v. Iron World Mfg., LLC, 680 F. Supp. 2d 337, 342 (D. Mass. 2010)
(quoting Hadfield v. A.W. Chesterton Company, 2009 WL 3085921, * 2 (Mass. Super. 2009)).
This presumption against the extraterritorial application of Chapter 151 must be upheld because
the statute’s legislative history reveals that it was meant to apply only to Massachusetts workers

6

Case 1:11-cv-10693-GAO Document 63 Filed 06/14/11 Page 7 of 20

as the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has recognized. See Swift v. Autozone, Inc., 441
Mass. 443, 447-450 (2004). Specifically, the SJC noted that when the legislation to create
Chapter 151 was being contemplated, “the Governor urged the Legislature to enact a ‘State Fair
Labor Standards Law’ to provide overtime compensation for those Massachusetts workers not
covered by Federal law.” Id. at 448-49 (citing 1960 Senate Doc. No. 1, at 22) (emphasis added).
As the SJC acknowledged, “[t]he Legislature responded affirmatively” to the Governor by
enacting G.L. c 151, § 1A. Id. at 449. Thus, as the SJC has noted, Chapter 151’s legislative
history is clear that it was designed to, and still does, apply only to Massachusetts employees.3
Accordingly, the presumption against extraterritorial application of Chapter 151 cannot be
rebutted.
Several courts have also recently recognized that the Massachusetts wage laws must not
be applied extraterritorially whereas there was no legislative intent to rebut the recognized
presumption against such. See Telford, 680 F. Supp. 2d at 342; Hadfield, 2009 WL 3085921 at *
2. This was a matter of first impression for the court in Hadfield. 2009 WL 3085921 at *2.
There, the court held that the Massachusetts wage laws may not be applied to employees whose
employment predominantly takes place outside of Massachusetts.4 Id. The Hadfield court even
reached this conclusion despite the fact that the plaintiff had an employment agreement with the
defendant which contained a Massachusetts choice of law provision – something which Ms. Litz
does not have. Id. at * 2-3. The court in Telford has since cited to the holding of Hadfield with

3

After thorough research, counsel represents that no cases were found which held that the legislative history
of Chapter 151 permitted its extraterritorial application.
4
The fact that plaintiff worked outside of the United States was not the basis for the court’s decision, but
rather only that he worked outside of Massachusetts. Hadfield, 2009 WL 3085921 at *2 (“The Court has found no
legislative intent to rebut the presumption that the Wage Act does not apply outside of Massachusetts.”) (emphasis
added).

7

Case 1:11-cv-10693-GAO Document 63 Filed 06/14/11 Page 8 of 20

approval, agreeing that the Massachusetts wage laws should not be applied extraterritorially.5
680 F. Supp. 2d at 342.
As both of these courts acknowledged, the appropriate inquiry for the applicability of
Massachusetts wage laws is “whether the employee worked in Massachusetts.” Telford, 680 F.
Supp. 2d at 342; Hadfield, 2009 WL 3085921 at * 2. Hadfield further clarified that it is “the site
of plaintiff’s work that determines where the relevant conduct occurred, not where managerial
decisions are made.” 2009 WL 3085921 at * 5; see also Priyanto v. M/S Amsterdam, 2009 WL
175739, * 7 (C.D. Cal. 2009) (“Courts interpreting other states’ wage laws have … focused on
the situs of an employee’s work in determining if a wage law applies, not where managerial
decisions, actions, or inactions occur.”). As these cases demonstrate, Massachusetts wage laws,
including Chapter 151, should not be applied extraterritorially where an individual does not work
in Massachusetts. Accordingly, whereas Plaintiff and a majority of the putative class members
do not work or reside in Massachusetts, Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend must be denied with
prejudice.
iii.

Other Courts Have Found That State Wage Laws May Not Be Applied
Extraterritorially

While Plaintiff asks this Court to apply Chapter 151 to nonresidents who did not work in
the state, regardless of other contacts, a thorough research of caselaw nationwide has not
revealed any decisions in which a court has done so for any state’s wage laws. See Priyanto,
2009 WL 175739 at * 7. Rather, a significant number of courts have found that the wage laws of
various states cannot be applied extraterritorially. See, e.g., Colson v. Avnet, Inc., 687 F. Supp.
2d 914, 922 (D. Ariz. 2010) (Arizona’s wage laws do not apply extraterritorially); Cruz v.

5

While the Telford court found that Massachusetts wage laws should not be applied extraterritorially, it
found that they were applicable to the plaintiff in that case where it was undisputed that he worked three days per
week in Massachusetts. 680 F. Supp. 2d at 342.

Lawson Software, Inc., 2010 WL 890038, * 7-9 (D. Minn. 2010) (Minnesota’s wage laws do
“not apply extraterritorially to a plaintiff who is not a resident of Minnesota and has neither lived
nor worked in Minnesota.”); Priyanto, 2009 WL 175739 at * 7 (California’s wage laws do not
apply extraterritorially where plaintiffs did not work in California); Sawyer v. Market America,
Inc., 190 N.C. App. 791, 794–95 (2008) (North Carolina’s wage laws do not apply
extraterritorially); Tomlinson v. Checkpoint Systems, Inc., 2008 WL 219217, * 9-10 (E.D. Pa.
2008) (Pennsylvania’s wage laws do not apply extraterritorially); Hamilton v. Water Whole
Intern. Corp., 2007 WL 1832025, * 3 (W.D. Okla. 2007) (Oklahoma’s wage laws do not apply
extraterritorially); Mitchell v. Abercrombie & Fitch, 2005 WL 1159412, * 3 (S.D. Ohio 2005)
(Ohio’s wage laws don’t apply extraterritorially where plaintiff worked outside of the state);
Vengurlekar v. Silverline Technologies, Ltd., 220 F.R.D. 222, 231 (S.D. N.Y. 2003) (New
Jersey’s wage laws do not apply extraterritorially); Rathje v. Scotia Prince Cruises, Ltd., 2001
WL 1636961, * 9 (D. Me. 2001) (Maine’s wage laws do not apply extraterritorially to employees
who do not perform work in Maine even though their employer happens to be based there);
Glass v. Kemper Corp., 133 F.3d 999, 1000-01 (7th Cir. 1998) (Illinois’ wage laws do not apply
extraterritorially); Vendetti v. Compass Environmental, Inc., 2006 WL 3694852, * 1-2 (N.D. Ill.
2006) (same); Hammell v. Paribas, 1993 WL 426844, * 1 (S.D. N.Y. 1993) (New York’s Labor
Law does not apply extraterritorially). Thus, courts nationwide have recognized that it is
improper to apply a state’s wage laws extraterritorially.
iv.

Applying Chapter 151 Extraterritorially To The Putative Class Would Be
Unconstitutional

The Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution prohibits a state from regulating
the working conditions of a nonresident who performs work and earns wages outside of the state.
Mitchell, 2005 WL 1159412 at * 3. “The Commerce Clause not only confers power on the

9

Case 1:11-cv-10693-GAO Document 63 Filed 06/14/11 Page 10 of 20

federal government, ‘it is also a substantive restriction on permissible state regulation of
interstate commerce.’” Id. (quoting Dennis v. Higgins, 498 U.S. 439, 447 (1991)). The U.S.
Supreme Court has long held that “[l]egislation is presumptively territorial and confined to limits
over which the law-making power has jurisdiction.” Sandberg v. McDonald, 248 U.S. 185, 195
(1918) (citing American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., 213 U.S. 347 (1909)). “No law has any
effect, of its own force, beyond the limits of the sovereignty from which its authority is derived.”
Hilton v. Guyot, 159 U.S. 113, 163 (1895). What Plaintiff asks this Court to do with respect to
the application of Chapter 151 runs afoul of these long-standing constitutional principles.
Few courts have addressed this issue with respect to the extraterritorial application of a
state’s wage law to a nationwide putative class. However, those courts that have looked at this
issue have found that a blanket application of any state law to a putative class – as Plaintiff asks
this Court to do – would violate the United States Constitution. See Cruz, 2010 WL 890038 at *
7-9 (holding that blanket application of Minnesota law governing overtime to putative class
members in various states would be unconstitutional); Barrus v. Dick’s Sporting Goods, Inc.,
732 F. Supp. 2d 243, 252-253 (W.D. N.Y. 2010) (finding that blanket application of New York
law governing unpaid wages to putative class members in various states would violate the Erie
doctrine); Mitchell, 2005 WL 1159412 at * 3 (finding that application of Ohio law governing
overtime to nonresidents who work outside of the state would violate the Commerce Clause of
the U.S. Constitution). Accordingly, Plaintiff’s requested blanket application of Chapter 151 to
the putative class in this action would be unconstitutional and her Motion to Amend must
therefore be denied with prejudice.

Case 1:11-cv-10693-GAO Document 63 Filed 06/14/11 Page 11 of 20

iv.

The Cases Cited To By Plaintiff Are Inapposite

Plaintiff’s cited authority is inapposite and her reliance on the three cases cited within her
Motion to Amend is misplaced. Plaintiff places most of her reliance on Gonyou v. Tri-Wire
Engineering Solutions, Inc., 717 F. Supp. 2d 152 (D. Mass 2010) in an attempt to support her
argument that this court should apply Chapter 151 to all employees who neither live nor work in
Massachusetts, but who happen to have a global employer who is headquartered there. In
Gonyou, the court held that a Massachusetts resident could bring a claim under G.L. c. 151, § 1A
against his Massachusetts employer for work performed in Connecticut where there was no
conflict of laws between Connecticut and Massachusetts. Id. at 155. Initially, it must be noted
that the Gonyou court did not consider the legislative history of Chapter 151 or its statutory
language referencing its applicability to individuals “employed in any occupation in the
commonwealth.”6 Therefore, it did not perform a complete evaluation as to whether the
presumption against extraterritoriality can be rebutted – which, as explained above in Section
II.B.ii, it cannot. See Telford, 680 F. Supp. 2d at 342.
Furthermore, the key component to the court’s holding in Gonyou was that the plaintiff
was a “Massachusetts resident who allegedly lived in Massachusetts for the majority of the
period of his employment.” 717 F. Supp. 2d at 155 (distinguishing cases cited by defendant,
stating “more importantly, the plaintiffs in those cases worked not only outside the state but were
generally non-residents (and sometimes even foreigners).”). The Gonyou court was also explicit
that it was not creating a general rule regarding the applicability of Chapter 151 to out-of-state

6

Indeed, the Gonyou court incorrectly stated that the statute does not refer to “any ‘employee in the
commonwealth.’” 717 F. Supp. 2d at 155 (emphasis in original); compare G.L. c. 151, § 1 (“[i]t is hereby declared
to be against public policy for an employer to employ any person in an occupation in this commonwealth at an
oppressive and unreasonable wage ….”) (emphasis added); see also G.L. c. 151, § 3(1).

11

Case 1:11-cv-10693-GAO Document 63 Filed 06/14/11 Page 12 of 20

employees, stating: “As is eminently clear, this is a motion to dismiss and this ruling is strictly
limited to the facts and circumstances of this case and this motion.” Id. (emphasis added).
Unlike, the plaintiff in Gonyou, Ms. Litz and a majority of the putative class members are
not Massachusetts residents. In fact, some of the putative class members worked internationally
– a situation which Gonyou states is expressly distinguishable from its holding. 717 F. Supp. 2d
at 155 (referring to “the applicability of state statutes internationally, [as a] clearly a
distinguishable situation.”). Thus, the facts and circumstances of the instant action are
distinguishable from those in Gonyou. Plaintiff’s request for this Court to extend the holding in
Gonyou is therefore without merit.
Plaintiff also cites two unpublished minute entry rulings as her only other support for the
unprecedented request she has made to this Court.7 See Davis v. The Footbridge Co., LLC, Civil
Action No. 09-11133-NG, minute entry (D. Mass. Oct. 5, 2010); Solis v. Cymfony, Inc.,
Middlesex Civ. A. No. 10-03384 (Mass. Super. Mar. 7, 2011). Prior to allowing the plaintiff in
Davis to amend her complaint to add a claim under Chapter 151, Judge Gertner stated:
“Defendants’ strongest argument is that the amendment is that the amendment would be futile.
Indeed, the plaintiff’s amendment of a Massachusetts statutory claim is unusual.” Civil Action
No. 09-11133-NG, minute entry (D. Mass. Oct. 5, 2010). Judge Gertner then highlighted the fact
that the plaintiff had an employment contract which “includes a Massachusetts choice of law
provision.” Id. This was a critical factor in the ruling. Here however, neither Ms. Litz nor the
putative class members had employment agreements with Massachusetts choice of law
provisions. Therefore, Davis is not controlling.

7

This Court should not consider the minute-entry rulings cited by Plaintiff as precedential given that they are
unpublished rulings which are void of context and full discussion of the arguments raised by the parties. See
Stanfield v. Island Operating Co., 2007 WL 3408285, * 4 (E.D. La. 2007) (finding that for a minute entry ruling,
“its precedential weight is doubtful.”).

12

Case 1:11-cv-10693-GAO Document 63 Filed 06/14/11 Page 13 of 20

Finally, the Solis ruling is also inapplicable to this case. Initially, the minute entry does
not provide any description of where the plaintiff resided during her employment, the level of
contact she had with Massachusetts, what percentage of her work was performed in
Massachusetts, or whether the defendant maintained facilities outside of Massachusetts. Solis,
Middlesex Civ. A. No. 10-03384 (Mass. Super. Mar. 7, 2011). Given these unknowns, it is not
possible to tell what possible relevance this ruling could have to the instant action. Indeed, the
one fact that can be discerned from the ruling is that the court was dealing with a claim under
G.L. c. 149, § 148B – not a Chapter 151 claim as in this case. Id. Finally, this minute-entry
ruling is void of any discussion of the arguments made by the parties, the context of the case and
the precedent/reasons upon which the court issued its ruling. Id. Thus, Solis must not be given
any precedential weight in this action.
Accordingly, Plaintiff has not provided any support for her unprecedented request that
this Court allow her to bring a class action claim under Chapter 151 despite her and the majority
of the putative class not being residents, not having worked in Massachusetts and not having
employment agreements with a Massachusetts choice of law provision. Therefore, her Motion to
Amend must be denied with prejudice.
C.

Plaintiff’s Proposed Second Amended Complaint Fails To Meet The
Prerequisites For A Class Action Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)

Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend seeks to add a Massachusetts state law claim as a class
action claim. However, Plaintiff fails to meet the prerequisites for class actions under Fed. R.
Civ. P. 23(a). Initially, the proposed class does not meet Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)’s commonality
requirement given that the putative members were employed in various states and countries by
TSCG. In the event that this Court agrees with Plaintiff’s unprecedented position that Chapter
151 can apply extraterritorially to nonresidents who do not work in Massachusetts, it would still

13

Case 1:11-cv-10693-GAO Document 63 Filed 06/14/11 Page 14 of 20

be required to conduct a conflict-of-laws analysis for each individual putative class member
based upon the laws of the state in which he or she actually worked. As courts have recognized,
this fails to meet Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)’s commonality requirement.
Furthermore, Plaintiff has failed to adequately plead that the proposed class is so
numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. Finally, Plaintiff failed to sufficiently
plead that she can fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. Where a proposed
amendment to assert a class action fails to meet these prerequisites, courts should deny the
motion to amend. Landgraff, 2007 WL 1101277 at * 3; Dong, 197 F.3d at 804; Smith, 953 F.2d
at 1033. Thus, this Court must deny Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend with prejudice.
i.

The Proposed Class Does Not Meet Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)’s Commonality
Requirement

In order to maintain a class action claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a), Plaintiff must be
able to meet the Rule’s commonality requirement. Plaintiff cannot do so here because the Court
would be required to conduct a conflict of laws analysis for every state an individual putative
class member worked in. Thus, each putative class member has his or her own individual
essential questions of law which are not shared by all other members of the putative class.
Accordingly, Plaintiff cannot meet Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)’s commonality requirement and her
Motion to Amend must therefore be denied with prejudice.
Courts have found that Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)’s commonality requirement is not met where
the substantive law of multiple states must be applied. See Lewis Tree Serv., Inc. v. Lucent
Techs. Inc., 211 F.R.D. 228, 231 (S.D. N.Y. 2002); see also Pilgrim v. Universal Health Card,
LLC, 2010 WL 1254849, * 4 (N.D. Ohio 2010) (class action cannot be maintained where the
laws of multiple states, which are implicated, differ). In particular, courts have repeatedly found
that the commonality requirement of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) cannot be met where the wage laws of

14

Case 1:11-cv-10693-GAO Document 63 Filed 06/14/11 Page 15 of 20

multiple states are implicated. See Scherer v. Combined Ins. Co. of America, 253 F.R.D. 40, 43
(D. Conn. 2008) (“the questions of law are not common to the subclass because 36 state wage
statutes are implicated.”); Neary v. Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Co., 472 F.
Supp. 2d 247, 251-53 (D. Conn. 2007) (Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)’s commonality requirement not met
where wage laws of 50 states were implicated); Glewwe v. Eastman Kodak Co., 2006 WL
1455476, * 4 (W.D. N.Y. 2006) (Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)’s commonality requirement not met where
wage laws of 35 states were implicated); Vengurlekar, 220 F.R.D. at 231 (finding that where it
was “far from clear that the New Jersey statute applies to all of the wage claims of the proposed
class members”, plaintiff failed to meet Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)’s commonality requirement for a
nationwide putative class).
While Plaintiff’s proposed Second Amended Complaint does not provide any allegations
concerning where the putative class members worked, it is indisputable that the project managers
work in various states throughout the United States and in other countries as well – with a
majority working and residing outside of Massachusetts. So even if the Court finds that it is
possible to apply Chapter 151 to a nonresident who does not work in Massachusetts – which
Defendants argue it is not – the Court would have to first conduct a conflict of law analysis for
each state in which that individual actually worked.8 Indeed, the Gonyou case – which Plaintiff
bases her argument upon – demonstrates that such an inquiry is a threshold issue for any
potential extraterritorial application of Chapter 151. 717 F. Supp. 2d at 155 (finding that G.L. c.
151, § 1A did not conflict with Connecticut law before holding that Massachusetts resident could
maintain a claim under the statute). Thus, Plaintiff’s proposed amendment would require this
Court to apply and analyze the overtime laws of a substantial number of states – something
8

These analyses will inevitably reveal that not all of the putative class members will have standing to bring a
claim under Chapter 151 because, as the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has recognized, “[m]any states do
not have overtime laws comparable to Massachusetts ….” Swift, 441 Mass. at 450, n. 11.

15

Case 1:11-cv-10693-GAO Document 63 Filed 06/14/11 Page 16 of 20

which does not fall within the commonality requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). Accordingly,
whereas Plaintiff’s proposed amendment fails to meet the commonality requirements of Fed. R.
Civ. P. 23(a), it fails and her Motion to Amend should be denied with prejudice.
ii.

The Proposed Class Is Not So Numerous That Joinder Is Impracticable

While Plaintiff’s proposed Second Amended Complaint identifies TSCG’s project
managers as the putative class she seeks to represent, it does not contain any allegations
concerning the size of this class. Indeed, Plaintiff’s proposed Second Amended Complaint does
not assert any allegations as to why the putative class would be so numerous as to render joinder
impracticable. Thus, Plaintiff’s proposed amendment fails on the basis of her insufficient
pleading alone.
Despite Plaintiff’s failure to plead such, Defendants acknowledge that TSCG has
employed approximately 45 project managers since September, 2007. (See Gould Aff. at ¶ 2).
Many courts have recognized that putative classes of this size, or larger, do not meet the
numerosity requirement of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). See, e.g., Pruitt v. City of Chicago, Illinois, 472
F.3d 925, 926 (7th Cir. 2006) (class of fewer than 40 employees did not meet numerosity
requirement); Andrews v. Bechtel Power Corp., 780 F.2d 124, 132 (1st Cir. 1985) (subclass of 49
members did not meet numerosity requirement); In re Colonial Partnership Litigation, 1993 WL
306526, * 42-43 (D. Conn. 1993) (class of 50 members did not meet numerosity requirement);
Block v. First Blood Associates, 125 F.R.D. 39 (S.D. N.Y. 1989) (class of 59 members did not
meet numerosity requirement); John Doe I v. Meese, 690 F.Supp. 1572, 1573-74 (S.D. Tex.
1988) (class between 59 and 62 members did not meet numerosity requirement); Uniondale Beer
Co., Inc. v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 117 F.R.D. 340, 345 (E.D. N.Y. 1987) (class of approximately
100 did not meet numerosity requirement). Thus, whereas Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that

16

Case 1:11-cv-10693-GAO Document 63 Filed 06/14/11 Page 17 of 20

the putative class is so numerous as to render joinder impracticable, she has failed to meet the
prerequisites of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). Accordingly, her Motion to Amend should be denied with
prejudice.
iii.

Plaintiff Has Failed To Sufficiently Plead That She Can Fairly And
Adequately Protect The Interests Of The Proposed Class

Plaintiff’s proposed Second Amended Complaint does not contain any allegations about
her ability to fairly and adequately represent the putative class members. Rather, it only asserts
that Plaintiff and the putative class members were employed as project managers who were
allegedly paid on an hourly basis without receiving overtime. These contentions do not
demonstrate that Ms. Litz is a proper representative of the putative class with the ability to fairly
and adequately represent the putative members’ interests. Accordingly, the proposed Second
Amended Complaint fails to sufficiently plead the prerequisites of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).
As several courts have recognized, a complaint fails to meet the prerequisites of Fed. R.
Civ. P. 23(a) where it does not sufficiently plead the named plaintiff’s ability to represent a class.
See Worthen v. Oklahoma Dept. of Corrections, 2007 WL 4563665, * 4 (W.D. Okla. 2007)
(“Here, Plaintiff has failed to plead, let alone establish, any factual or legal basis for finding that
he would be an adequate class representative for all purported class members.”); Alvarado
Morales v. Digital Equipment Corp., 669 F.Supp. 1173, 1186 (D. Puerto Rico 1987) (“Plaintiffs
also fail to plead facts sufficient to show that they are in a position to adequately represent or
protect the interests of the class.”) The United States Supreme Court has also acknowledged the
necessity for precise pleadings with respect to class action claims under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).
General Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160-61 (1982) (citing Johnson v.
Georgia Highway Exp., Inc., 417 F.2d 1122, 1125-27 (5th Cir. 1969)). In particular it

17

Case 1:11-cv-10693-GAO Document 63 Filed 06/14/11 Page 18 of 20

recognized that specificity is needed in order to be able determine whether the representation is
adequate as required by the Rule. Id.
Whereas Plaintiff’s proposed Second Amended Complaint fails to sufficiently plead her
ability to fairly and adequately represent the putative class, it fails to meet the prerequisites of
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend should be dismissed with
prejudice.
D.

Defendants Will Be Unduly Prejudiced If Plaintiff’s Motion To Amend Is
Granted

Defendants will be significantly prejudiced if Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend is granted.
Plaintiff’s proposed amendment seeks to transform this case into a class action lawsuit under
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. Such an amendment would substantially alter these proceedings to
Defendants’ detriment. See Daugherty v. American Express Co., 2010 WL 27735116, * 3-4
(W.D. Ky. 2010) (holding that “allowing Plaintiff to amend him complaint to include these class
claims would be prejudicial.”). Granting “[l]eave to amend here would do far more than allow
plaintiff to fully litigate all the legal dimensions of [her] initial action, it would permit plaintiff to
transform [her] case into something entirely new.” Mississippi Ass'n of Cooperatives v. Farmers
Home Admin., 139 F.R.D. 542, 544 (D. D.C. 1991) (affirming denial of leave where plaintiff
sought to add class action claims); see also Graham v. Progressive Direct Insurance Co., 271
F.R.D. 112, 123 (W.D. Pa. 2010). While Plaintiff has currently brought a collective action claim
under the FLSA, the scope and complexity of litigating that claim is significantly different than
that of a class action claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.
For an FLSA collective action, putative class members must affirmatively opt in to the
action in order to participate. However, class actions under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 proceed as if all
putative members are part of the lawsuit unless they otherwise opt out. Here, only one putative

18

Case 1:11-cv-10693-GAO Document 63 Filed 06/14/11 Page 19 of 20

member other than Plaintiff – Ms. Payne – has opted into the collective action. Thus, the scope
of the discovery in the instant action is currently limited to those two individuals who have
chosen to participate in the lawsuit. This scope will drastically expand to approximately 45
individuals if Plaintiff is permitted to add a class action claim. Such an automatic expansion of
discovery will significantly prejudice Defendants. See Weber v. Sanborn, 526 F. Supp. 2d 135,
142 (D. Mass. 2007) (denying plaintiff’s motion to amend where newly added claim would
necessitate additional discovery); Kovian v. Fulton County National Bank and Trust Co., 1992
WL 106814, * 2 (N.D. N.Y. 1992) (“A motion to amend a pleading will also be denied if the
amendment would cause undue prejudice to the opposing party, by requiring additional
discovery or unnecessarily complicating the litigation.”).
This significant prejudice to Defendants is particularly unwarranted where Plaintiff’s
proposed amendment merely seeks to add a new legal theory based upon the same facts
contained in the original complaint. Plaintiff – whose counsel is the same as that of Mr. Mayo –
provides no reason whatsoever as to why the proposed claim was not included in the original
Complaint. Where a plaintiff seeks to add claims which could have been brought at the time of
the original complaint, it is appropriate for a court to deny leave to amend. See Mogel v. UNUM
Life Ins. Co. of America, 677 F. Supp. 2d 362, 365 (D. Mass. 2009) (citing Acri v. Int'l Ass'n of
Machinists & Aerospace Workers, 781 F.2d 1393, 1398 (9th Cir. 1986)). Indeed, “amendments
to assert new theories are not reviewed favorably when the facts and the theory have been known
to the party seeking amendment since the inception of the cause of action.” Acri, 781 F.2d at
1398; see also Messier v. Southbury Training School, 1999 WL 20907, * 3 (D. Conn. 1999);
Phaneuf v. Tenneco, Inc., 938 F.Supp. 112, 116 (N.D. N.Y. 1996) (Court denied motion for leave
to amend where “nothing new has come to light in between the time that the original complaint

19

Case 1:11-cv-10693-GAO Document 63 Filed 06/14/11 Page 20 of 20

was filed and the time the motion to amend was made.”). Thus, whereas Defendants will be
unduly prejudiced from Plaintiff’s proposed amendment – which could have been brought at the
time of her original complaint – this Court should deny the Motion to Amend.
III.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, Defendants respectfully request that this Court deny the

Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend in its entirety.
Defendants respectfully request a hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion for a Protective Order.
