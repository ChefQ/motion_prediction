PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO FILE SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT
This case was recently transferred to the District of Massachusetts from the Northern
District of Illinois on an uncontested motion by Defendants Saint Consulting Group, Inc., P.
Michael Saint and Patrick Fox. Now, pursuant to Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, Plaintiffs move for permission to amend the operative complaint in the form attached
as “Exhibit A.” The proposed amended complaint would add a state law claim for failure to pay
overtime compensation in violation of M.G.L. c. 151, § 1A, which, Plaintiffs allege, should
apply extraterritorially to all of Defendants operations throughout the country. See, e.g., Gonyou
v. Tri-Wire Engineering Solutions, Inc., 717 F. Supp. 2d 152 (D. Mass. 2010) (applying
Massachusetts Overtime Law to employees performing work for Massachusetts-based employer
outside of Massachusetts); Solis v. Cymfony, Inc., Middlesex Civ. A. No. 10-03384, order
denying motion to dismiss (Mass. Super. Mar. 7, 2011) (applying Massachusetts Independent
Contractor Law to plaintiffs who worked outside of Massachusetts; “a Massachusetts employer
should not be able to escape potential liability for mischaracterizing an employee as an

independent contractor simply because the work at issue was performed outside of
Massachusetts”); Davis v. The Footbridge Companies, LLC, Civil Action No. 09-11133-NG,
minute entry (D. Mass. Oct. 5, 2010) (allowing plaintiff, who lived in Alabama, amend
complaint to assert Massachusetts wage law claims; “[A]t least one court in this District has
found the Massachusetts wage laws may apply to Massachusetts employers even where the
employee was not working in the state at the time of injury”).
Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that “leave [to amend a
complaint] shall be freely given when justice so requires.” As this Court has observed, “[t]his
phrase is usually interpreted as an affirmation of the liberal approach to pleading taken by the
modern rules, and as an encouragement to district judges to decide a plaintiff’s claims on the
merits whenever possible.” McMillan v. Massachusetts Soc. for Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, 168 F.R.D. 94, 97 (D. Mass. 1995). Here, it is particularly appropriate to allow
Plaintiffs to amend the complaint to assert their additional state law claim against Defendants,
which are headquartered in Massachusetts. Moreover, amendment is appropriate given that this
case is still in its early procedural stages, having just been transferred to this Court, and with
neither party having commenced discovery or engaged in any substantive briefing. Accordingly,
under Rule 15(a)’s liberal standard, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court grant them
leave to amend their complaint.
