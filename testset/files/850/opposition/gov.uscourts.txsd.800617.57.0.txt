PLAINTIFF TARGET TRAINING INTERNATIONAL, LTD.'S
OPPOSITION TO EXTENDED DISC NORTH AMERICA, INC.'S
MOTION TO STAY PENDING REEXAMINATION

Extended DISC North America, Inc. (EDNA) has requested a stay of indeterminate
length in a motion raising much the same issues as its previous Motion to Stay. In that previous
motion, EDNA noted that its `franchisor' Extended DISC Intemational, Ltd. ("EDI") had
requested ex-parte reexamination of U.S. Patent No. 7,249,372 (the '372 Patent) on January 14,
2011. (Docket 24, 0x00A7 4). EDNA also made several references to the fact that the "PTO has three
months from the date of filing the request to decide whether a substantial question of
patentability exists." (See Docket 24, 7 25). While the PTO's determination was originally due on
April 14, 2011, the determination was actually issued on April 25, 2011 - nearly a week and a
half late. (Docket 53, p. 5).

While this week and a half delay may not be very large, it underscores a larger point -

almost any interaction with the Patent Office will take longer than expected. Here, the delay was
Case 4:10-cv-03350 Document 57 _ Filed in TXSD on 05/16/11 Page 2 of 10

partially caused by the initial denial of EDI's reexamination request. (Exhibit "A"). Faced with
this rejection, EDI filed another request and, on this second try, finally joined the 92% of granted
ex-parte reexamination requests. (Docket 53-1, p. 4). Because EDI has finally managed to clear
this hurdle, EDNA now seeks a complete stay of the proceedings. EDNA seeks this stay even
though the reexamination will not have any preclusive effect on EDNA, a non-party to the
reexam, and will not address the indefiniteness issues raised by EDNA.!

Further, the delay necessary to accommodate reexamination proceedings is quite large
indeed. The Patent Office itself reports an average pendency of 25.7 months, however, these
statistics include data from the 1980's and 1990's during which (due to lower volumes) requests
were processed in significantly less time. (Docket 53-1, p. 5; Exhibit B'). In reality, the average
pendency of the reexamination proper is closer to three years with any appeals to the Board of
Patent Appeals and Interferences likely bringing the average to six years. Belden Techs. Inc. v.
Superior Essex Communs. LP, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90960 at 9 (D. Del. Sept. 2, 2010);
(Exhibit "B"). Appeal to the Federal Circuit would further extend the time. Belden Techs. Inc.,
2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90960 at 9. Such statistics have caused courts to rethink stays pending
litigation, even going so far as to say "only those reexamination proceedings that have been
substantially completed will weigh in favor of a stay. Jd. at 10.

Moreover, EDI's reexamination request relies upon references cited under 35 U.S.C. 0x00A7

102(a). (Docket 53-1, p. 9). These references can be eliminated by "swearing behind" the

 

"To be fair, EDNA did offer to stipulate to some preclusive effect of this reexamination. Namely, EDNA offered to
stipulate that the USPTO's decision on reexamination would be binding only as to the four references currently
under consideration-leaving EDNA free to raise any other references, known or unknown, in the present ligation.
Reexamination is also limited to prior publications only, leaving all other issues for litigation. 35 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A7 301-
302.

reference (demonstrating invention of the claimed subject matter prior to the effective date of the
reference), 37 C.F.R. 0x00A7 1.131. This procedure was performed in the original prosecution of the
`372 Patent and Target Training International, Inc, ("TTI") expects that it will likewise be able to
swear behind the references submitted in the reexamination. (Exhibit "(C"). Due to the length of
pendency, successful completion of this fairly simple and straight forward procedure will still
likely take approximately two years. (Exhibit "B").

Meanwhile, in the two to six years necessary to conclude the reexamination proceeding,
EDNA will be free to continue infringing the '372 Patent - a patent entitled to a presumption of
validity. 35 U.S.C. 0x00A7 282. Continuing with the case will allow this Court to conclusively
determine all issues of validity - including ENDA's claims of indefiniteness - between the
parties, Further, this determination will be made in significantly less time that it will take the
Patent Office to confirm all of the claims in reexamination. Simply put, there is no reason to let
this case linger on this Court's docket. As a result, TTI respectfully requests that EDNA's
Motion to Stay be denied.
I. BACKGROUND

TTI filed this case on September 17, 2010, alleging that EDNA's activities regarding the
Extended DISC System infringe TTI's '372 Patent which concerns systems for assessment
instruments used to evaluate employees and potential employees. Over the past seven months,
EDNA has filed a number of motions and requested a number of extensions-the result of which
has been delay of the case. Notwithstanding these delays, the case appears on track for its
currently scheduled pretrial conference date of June 4, 2012.

EDNA's most recent request for an extension was on April 28, 2011 when EDNA

requested "a modest, one-week extension of time to comply with P.R. 4-2 (exchange of
Case 4:10-cv-03350 Document 57 _ Filed in TXSD on 05/16/11 Page 4 of 10

preliminary claim constructions and extrinsic evidence.)" (Docket 45, p 1). In making its request,
counsel for EDNA stated that it was "working diligently to get up to speed on the case" and
stated that extending the deadline from April 29 to May 6 would "allow a more meaningful
exchange of proposed claim constructions." (Docket 45, p 1). The diligent work of EDNA's
counsel was revealed six days later when, instead of the promised claim constructions, EDNA
filed the present Motion to Stay the Litigation Pending Reexamination. (Docket 53).

This pattern of events bears a striking similarity to EDNA's previous Motion to Stay.
Before EDNA filed that motion, EDNA delayed discovery and claim construction deadlines by
requesting courtesy extensions, during which extension period EDNA filed its motion. (Docket
27, pp. 8-9). EDNA's purported reason for requesting the extensions was EDNA's pending
Motion to Dismiss, and EDNA failed to mention any intent to file for reexamination and request
a stay. However EDNA used the delay caused by the extension to support its Motion to Stay.
(Docket 27, pp. 8-9). Now, with this present motion, it appears that EDNA has not used the
additional time provided by its request to focus on the matter at hand - preparing and polishing
its claim constructions - but rather filed yet another motion to stay.

Despite having this additional time to focus on its latest Motion to Stay, EDNA does
nothing more than rehash old ground by proffering oft-cited reexamination statistics and generic
judicial efficiency arguments. EDNA uses these well-worn arguments to prop up its request for a
multi-year stay with no preclusive effect on the parties. In sum, EDNA's motion simply attempts
to push its final day of reckoning for infringement further down the road in return for little (if

any) gains in judicial efficiency.

Ii. (c)EDNA MUST MEET ITS BURDEN WHEN REQUESTING A STAY

As stated in TTI's brief regarding EDNA's first Motion to Stay, the granting of a stay is
within a district court's discretion. Patlex Corp. v. Mossinghoff, 758 F.2d 594, 225 U.S.P.Q.
(BNA) 243 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Nevertheless, a stay pending reexamination should not be routinely
granted otherwise the procedure becomes "subject to inequity, if not manipulation and abuse,
through the delays that are inherent in PTO activities." Fresenius USA, Inc., 582 F.3d at 1306
(Newman, P. dissenting). Absent an adequate showing of the need for a stay, it is entirely proper
for litigation and reexamination to proceed concurrently as they "are not mutually exclusive
alternatives for the parties to test the validity of a patent." BarTex Research v. FedEx Corp., 611
F. Supp. 2d 647, 650 (E.D. Tex. 2009) (citations omitted).

In attempting to establish entitlement to a stay, EDNA must address three factors.
Namely, "1) whether a stay will unduly prejudice or present clear tactical disadvantage to the
nonmoving party, 2) whether a stay will simplify the issues in question and the trial of the case,
and 3) whether discovery is complete and whether a trial date has been set." BarTex Research,
611 F. Supp. 2d at 649-650 (citations omitted), "Each court considering a motion to stay pending
reexamination must properly weigh the enumerated factors on a case-by-case basis." /d.
(citations omitted). In evaluating the factors care must be taken to avoid tuming "reexamination
into an administrative process that must be completed before a suit for patent infringement may
move forward." BarTex Research, 611 F. Supp. 2d at 652 (E.D. Tex. 2009). Here, a careful

weighing of all three factors does not support a stay.
Case 4:10-cv-03350 Document 57 _ Filed in TXSD on 05/16/11 Page 6 of 10

I. THE CONTINUED INFRINGEMENT OF A COMPETITOR CONSTITUTES
UNDUE PREJUDICE

Where the parties are direct competitors, a stay would likely prejudice the non-movant.
Tesco Corp. v. Weatherford Int'l, Inc., 599 F. Supp. 2d 848, 851 (S.D. Tex. 2009) (collecting
cases). EDNA, however, apparently fails to appreciate the full scope of the case law as it places
undue emphasis on the lack of a motion for a preliminary injunction in this case. (Docket 53, p.
9). However, "[t]he request for a preliminary injunction is simply one (non-dispositive) indicia of
the presence of direct competition." Belden Techs. Inc. v. Superior Essex Communs. LP, 2010
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90960 n.4 (D. Del. Sept. 2, 2010).

Here, EDNA has already admitted that it "is an authorized reseller of EDI's online
assessment tools in North America" which "appears to be the target of TTI's patent infringement
suit." (Docket 24, pp. 2-3). TTI also sells assessment tools in North America. As a result, there
is no need for additional indicia to determine whether or not the parties compete. Because the
parties are competitors, EDNA's ongoing sales continue to erode TTI's market share. This
continued erosion (especially when coupled with EDNA's statements regarding its financial
instability) constitutes undue prejudice.' (Docket 24, 10); see also BarTex Res., LLC v. FedEx
Corp., 611 F. Supp. 2d 647, 652 (E.D. Tex. 2009),

IV. ASTAY WILL NOT SIMPLIFY THE ISSUES

In the Eastern District of Texas, Judge Folsom recently held that "[t]o convince this Court
that a stay will actually simplify a case, the requesting party must do more than merely proffer
oft-cited reexamination statistics and generic judicial efficiency arguments." Parallel Networks,

ELC v, Microsoft Corp., 2:09-cv-00172-DF (E.D. Tex. May 10, 2010). Indeed, if such "stock"

 

*EDNA seems to take issue with the fact that it is the first company to be sued under the '372 Patent. (Docket 53,
10). Simply put, EDNA is the first company that was unwilling to amend its ways when faced with its ongoing
infringement of the '372 Patent.

6
Case 4:10-cv-03350 Document 57 _ Filed in TXSD on 05/16/11 Page 7 of 10

arguments were sufficient to carry the day it would eliminate the need for consideration of this
factor and would, in effect, increase the risk of reexamination becoming "an administrative
process that must be completed before filing a suit for patent infringement may move forward."
BarTex Res., LLC, 611 F. Supp. 2d at 652. Instead, a particularized showing of how arguments
raised in the reexamination will simplify the issues for trial should be required. Here, EDNA has
devoted several pages to these stock arguments because a more particularized showing is not
possible.

As stated above, EDI's reexamination relies upon several references which can be
eliminated by filing a declaration pursuant to 37 C.F.R. 0x00A7 1.131. As a result, the only issue likely
to be determined in the reexamination is that TTI's invention date is earlier than the references
cited in the reexamination. This is a showing which, at best, will likely consume at least two
years' worth of time. Further, even if some changes to the claim scope are eventually made,
"justice will be better served by addressing that contingency when and if it occurs as opposed to
indefinitely staying the case pending reexamination." Nat'l Oilwell Vargo, L.P. v. Auto-Dril, Inc.,
2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90963 at 2-3 (E.D. Tex. Jan. 5, 2010).

As was previously noted, because EDI filed an ex parte reexamination request, EDNA is
not prevented from raising the same or a similar challenge again. See 35 U.S.C. 0x00A7 315(c) (an
inter partes reexamination requestor is precluded from asserting "the invalidity of any claim
finally determined to be valid and patentable on any ground which the third-party requester
raised or could have raised during the inter partes reexamination proceedings") (emphasis
added). As a result, for all practical purposes, the reexamination request will have no impact on
any validity issues. If, instead, this Court denies the requested stay, then the date of inventorship

as well as any other allegations of invalidity raised by EDNA can be fully addressed and
Case 4:10-cv-03350 Document 57 _ Filed in TXSD on 05/16/11 Page 8 of 10

determined by June 4, 2012, the date for Docket Call set out in the Scheduling Order of
December 14, 2010. Simply put, a multi-year stay to determine a single date seems a steep price
to pay.

V. THE PROCEDURAL POSTURE OF THIS CASE DOES NOT SUPPORT A STAY

Although there is indeed much more to do in this case, EDNA ignores the effort that has
already been expended. Discovery is underway, as is the Markman process. Last week TTI
provided its responses to EDNA's discovery requests. Indeed - although TT] has yet to receive
EDNA's latest round of document production (which was presumably sent via mail on May 13) -
if EDNA's Opposition to TTI's Motion to Compel is to be believed, it appears that EDNA has
finally decided to make an attempt at responding to discovery requests as well.

The effort required to achieve this level of progress has been considerable as TTI has had
to (figuratively) drag EDNA, kicking and screaming, through the discovery process over the past
four months. Had EDNA been a more willing participant, there is little doubt that the case would
have progressed even further.` Nevertheless, granting EDNA's requested stay would effectively
negate all of TTT's efforts and would also reward EDNA for its dilatory efforts. This case is on
track to definitively resolve the disputes between the parties in about one year; there is no reason
to derail it for a multi-year administrative proceeding considering references which can be sworm
behind by TTI.

VI. CONCLUSION

EDNA's request for a stay essentially boils down to its unwillingness to litigate this case

- a fact made painfully evident by EDNA's conduct regarding TTI's discovery requests. In its

brief, EDNA argues that TTI will suffer no undue prejudice by being forced to suffer ongoing

 

" After all, it is somewhat pointless to take a corporate deposition when EDNA is refusing to produce relevant
documents - exhibits produced after the deposition would simply serve to increase the cost and prejudice to TTI.

sales by a competitor for an indefinite period of time. EDNA then backs this position up with the
standard citations and statistics used in virtually all motions to stay pending reexamination
without discussing any of the arguments and references actually raised in the reexamination
request. Simply put, these generic arguments do not rise to the level of justifying an
indeterminate stay of this case.

A proposed order denying the stay is attached.
