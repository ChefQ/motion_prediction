INTRODUCTION
Following the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office’s (“PTO”) recent order granting Extended

DISC International, Ltd.'s (“EDI”)1 request for reexamination of U.S. Patent No. 7,249,372 (“the
’372 patent”), Defendant Extended DISC North America, Inc. (“EDNA”), now requests that the
Court stay this case to allow the PTO to reexamine whether the claims of the '372 patent are
invalid and/or unpatentable. As Plaintiff Target Training International, Ltd. (“TTI”) admitted in
its response to EDNA's first motion to stay, "there may be several advantages in granting a stay
pending reexamination."

TTI's First Response (Dkt. No. 27) at 3.

The advantages TTI

recognized three months ago are even more applicable now that the PTO has ordered
reexamination of all claims of the ‘372 patent.
In this motion, EDNA seeks a stay of this litigation pending the outcome of a
reexamination of the ’372 patent that the PTO ordered on April 25, 2011. In the reexamination
proceeding, the PTO will reconsider the patentability of all claims of the ’372 patent in view of
at least four pieces of prior art brought to the PTO’s attention in EDNA's Request for
Reexamination. In ordering reexamination, the PTO stated that each of these four references
raises a substantial question of patentability with respect to the claims of the ’372 patent. Given
that 77% of reexaminations result in claim amendment or cancellation, it is likely that the
asserted claims of the ’372 patent will not emerge from reexamination in their present form.
Schlather Decl.; Ex. A.
The Court should stay this litigation until the reexamination is completed for at least the
following reasons: (1) because TTI has not sought a preliminary injunction and because TTI has

1

Contrary to assertions in TTI’s response to EDNA’s first motion to stay (Dkt. No. 27), Defendant Extended
DISC North America, Inc. did not file the request for reexamination.

5

Case 4:10-cv-03350 Document 53

Filed in TXSD on 05/04/11 Page 6 of 17

an adequate remedy at law (i.e., the ability to collect monetary damages upon a showing of
infringement); (2) the stay will promote judicial efficiency because reexamination will likely
narrow issues or even eliminate the need for further litigation; and (3) the current stage of
litigation favors granting the stay because substantial discovery remains uncompleted, meaning a
stay would spare both the parties and this court from substantial needless expenses.

II.

FACT SUMMARY
TTI filed this case on September 17, 2010 asserting infringement of claims 1-2 and 5-11 of

the ’372 patent. There are no other patents or causes of action involved in this suit. TTI seeks
monetary damages and a permanent injunction of EDNA’s activities. See Complaint (Dkt. No. 1)
at 3-4. However, TTI did not seek a preliminary injunction of EDNA’s accused activities.
On January 21, 2011, EDNA filed a motion to stay this case in view of EDI’s request for ex
parte reexamination. Dkt. No. 24. At that time, the PTO had not made a decision as to whether
EDI's request would be granted. On February 15, 2011, the Court denied EDNA's initial motion
to stay. Dkt. No. 30.
On January 14, 2011, EDI filed a Request for Reexamination asking that the PTO
reconsider the patentability of all claims of the ’372 patent in view of various prior art
references. Schlather Decl., Ex. B – Request for Reexamination. On April 25, 2011, the PTO
issued an order granting EDI’s request for reexamination of all claims, 1-11, of the ’372 patent,
and determined that a substantial new question of patentability exists as to each claim. Schlather
Decl.; Ex. C – Order Granting Reexamination at 2. The reexamination will include every
reference cited by EDI in its request. Id. at 4-12.
Meanwhile, the litigation remains in the early phases of discovery. Both parties are still
engaged in document production. In addition, third party discovery and the taking of deposition
6

Case 4:10-cv-03350 Document 53

Filed in TXSD on 05/04/11 Page 7 of 17

testimony remain far from complete. The claim construction process has only just begun and
expert discovery has not yet commenced. The trial date is set for June 4, 2012, leaving a
substantial amount of time for additional discovery and trial preparation by both parties.

III.

ISSUE PRESENTED
Whether the Court should stay this litigation pending completion of the reexamination

where: (1) the PTO will determine the patentability of all claims asserted in this litigation in view
of the references submitted by EDNA; (2) the plaintiff did not seek a preliminary injunction, and
instead seeks money damages; (3) the plaintiff is not commercially harmed by any delay caused
by the stay; and (4) discovery is ongoing and the trial date is more than a year away.

IV.

LEGAL PRINCIPLES

A.

A Liberal Policy Exists for Staying Litigation Pending Reexamination

“The stay of pending litigation to enable PTO review of contested patents was one of the
specified purposes of the reexamination legislation.” Patlex Corp. v. Mossinghoff, 758 F.2d 594,
606 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Indeed, one of Congress’s primary purposes in creating the reexamination
procedure was to “permit efficient resolution of questions about the validity of issued patents
without recourse to expensive and lengthy infringement litigation” H.R. Rep. No. 1307, 96th
Cong., 2d Sess. 4, reprinted in 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6460, 6463; see also Gould v. Control Laser
Corp., 705 F.2d 1340, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (“One purpose of the reexamination procedure is to
eliminate trial of that issue (when the claim is canceled)”).
Given that the stay of litigation was an anticipated effect of reexamination, “there exists a
‘liberal policy in favor of granting motions to stay pending the outcome of reexamination
proceedings.’” Werre v. Battenfeld Technologies, Inc., No. Civ.03-1471-AA, 2004 WL 2554568,
7

Case 4:10-cv-03350 Document 53

at *1 (D. Or. November 9, 2004) (citations omitted); see also Scriptpro LLC v. Wal-Mart Stores,
Inc., No. 05-2244-CM, 2006 WL 2294859, at * 1 (D. Kan. August 8, 2006) (“liberal policy”);
ASCII Corp. v. STD Entm’t USA, Inc., 844 F. Supp. 1378, 1381 (N.D. Cal. 1994) (“liberal
policy”). This Court has the inherent power to stay this proceeding while the PTO determines
the patentability of all claims at issue. Ethicon, Inc. v. Quigg, 849 F.2d 1422, 1426-27 (Fed. Cir.
1988) (inherent authority extends to staying a case pending resolution of a reexamination in the
PTO); Cameras Onsite, LLC v. Digital Mgmt. Solutions, Inc., 2010 WL 1268054 (S.D. Tex. Mar.
24, 2010) (citing, Soverain Software LLC v. Amazon.com, 356 F.Supp.2d 660, 662 (E.D. Tex.
2005) (granting a motion to stay patent infringement suit pending reexamination).
B.

Three-Factor Analysis For Determining Whether A Stay is Proper, and
Potential Benefits of a Stay

Courts generally analyze three factors in deciding to stay a case pending reexamination:
"(1) whether a stay would unduly prejudice or present a clear tactical disadvantage to the
nonmoving party; (2) whether a stay will simplify the issues in question and trial of the case; and
(3) whether discovery is complete and whether a trial date has been set." Cameras Onsite, at *2
(citing, Echostar Tech. Corp. v. Tivo, Inc., 2006 WL 2501494 at *4 (E.D. Tex. July 14, 2006).
Additionally, in Echostar, Magistrate Judge Craven noted a number of potential benefits that
result from a stay, including: (1) the suit will likely be dismissed if the PTO determines the claim
to be invalid; (2) "[t]he outcome of the reexamination may encourage a settlement without the
further use of the Court;" (3) "[t]he record of the reexamination would likely be entered at trial,
thereby reducing the complexity and length of the litigation;" and (4) "[t]he cost will likely be
reduced for both the parties and the Court." Echostar, at **4-5.

THE COURT SHOULD STAY THIS ACTION PENDING REEXAMINATION OF
THE ‘372 PATENT BECAUSE ALL THREE FACTORS FAVOR A STAY

As explained more fully below, all three of the above factors weigh in favor of granting a
stay pending reexamination. Additionally, the potential benefits of a stay are particularly
applicable in this case.
A.

A Stay Will Not Unduly Prejudice Or Present A Clear Tactical Disadvantage
To TTI

The first factor to consider in determining the appropriateness of a stay pending
reexamination is whether the stay would unduly prejudice TTI. Undue prejudice would result if
the stay would deprive the plaintiff of an adequate remedy at law. See Broadcast Innovation,
LLC v. Charter Comm., Inc., No. 03-Cv-2223-ABJ-BNB, 2006 WL 1897165, at *10 (D. Colo.
July 11, 2006) (summarizing the “undue prejudice” factor in terms of whether the nonmoving
party retains an adequate remedy at law). Here, a stay of this suit pending reexamination will not
result in undue prejudice to TTI.
Specifically, TTI will not suffer undue prejudice because a stay would not obviate an
adequate remedy at law. If this litigation is stayed, TTI retains the ability to collect money
damages for any proven infringement. See Patlex Corp. v. Mossinghoff, 758 F.2d 594, 603 (Fed.
Cir. 1985) (noting that damages for any infringement continue to accrue during the period of the
stay). Notably, because TTI never moved for a preliminary injunction,2 TTI cannot now argue
that a stay would harm its place in the market.
In its response to EDNA's first motion to stay, TTI asserted that a stay would result in
undue prejudice. TTI's First Response (Dkt. No. 27) at 4. In support of this argument, TTI
asserted that the parties are direct competitors and that EDNA is "a small company." Id. at 5.
2

TTI did request a permanent injunction in its complaint, but the stay does not affect the availability of this remedy.

9

Case 4:10-cv-03350 Document 53

Filed in TXSD on 05/04/11 Page 10 of 17

TTI further alleges that a stay would be prejudicial because it could "lose...goodwill in the
market." However, here, as in Cameras Onsite, plaintiff's arguments are unavailing. As this
Court reasoned in Cameras Onsite, "Plaintiff's purported prejudice is attenuated because it
assumes (1) the ['372] Patent is valid and infringed by [EDNA]." Cameras Onsite, at *3.
Moreover, even if the Court denied the stay, since TTI has made no showing that it is entitled to
a preliminary injunction against EDNA, EDNA is free to continue its activities. Id.
In addition, it was TTI that chose to bring suit against a "small company" such as EDNA.
It cannot now complain EDNA may not have the financial resources to satisfy a patent
infringement judgment. As TTI admits, EDNA is a “small company.” There are a number of
larger firms engaged in the same business as EDNA. To date, TTI has ignored these “bigger
fish.” While TTI’s litigation strategy remains unknown, the fact that TTI has apparently ignored
more significant competitors evidences the weakness of TTI’s arguments regarding its purported
“goodwill in the market.”

In addition, TTI failed to provide any measure of its alleged

“goodwill”, how such “goodwill” would be quantified or how EDNA’s activities purportedly
impact this “goodwill.”

Clearly, such arguments are purely speculative and should be

disregarded.
At most, TTI can only complain that it is inconvenienced by the delay. However, “[t]he
delay inherent to the reexamination process does not constitute, by itself, undue prejudice.”
Photoflex Products, Inc. v. Circa 3 LLC, No. C 04-03715 JSW, 2006 WL 1440363, at *2 (N.D.
Cal. May 24, 2006); see also Alza Corp v. Wyeth, 2006 WL 3500015, at *1 (E.D. Tex. Nov. 21,
2006) (“Reexamination does not threaten protracted or indefinite delay.”).
The stay also does not tactically disadvantage TTI (or give a tactical advantage to EDNA).
To the contrary, a stay benefits both the parties and this court by permitting the PTO to assess

10

Case 4:10-cv-03350 Document 53

Filed in TXSD on 05/04/11 Page 11 of 17

patentability/validity before the parties incur additional costs of litigation and before the Court
invests significant additional time in the case. This avoids the risk of investing tremendous
resources preparing for trial on claims that may well be altered during reexamination. See Target
Therapeutics, Inc. v. SciMed Life Sys., Inc., 33 U.S.P.Q.2d 2022, 2023 (N.D. Cal. 1995)
(“Absent a stay, the parties may end up conducting a significantly wider scope of discovery than
necessary, and the court may waste time examining the validity of claims which are modified or
eliminated altogether during reexamination.”); see also Broadcast Innovation, 2006 WL
1897165, at *10. The benefit of this avoided risk inures not just to the Court and EDNA, but also
to TTI.
For these reasons, this factor favors a stay.
B.

A Stay Is Appropriate Because Reexamination Will Likely Narrow The
Issues And May Eliminate The Need For Further Litigation

The second factor—whether a stay will simplify the issues in question and the trial of the
case—also weighs in favor of a stay.
1.

Reexamination Is Likely To Simplify Litigation Issues

Patents rarely survive reexamination unscathed. In fact, 77% of ex parte reexamination
proceedings result in amendment or the complete invalidation of the claims. Ex. D. Of course,
invalidation of the ’372 patent would moot all issues in the case. Broadcast Innovation, LLC,
2006 WL 1897165, at *2 & *10 (“If no claims survive, neither does the court’s work....Neither
the Court nor the parties should expend additional resources when it is uncertain which, if any, of
the four asserted claims will survive the reexamination process.”). As for claim amendments,
even the amendment of a single claim of the ’372 patent could significantly alter the landscape in
this case. For instance, such an amendment would give rise to intervening rights, 35 U.S.C. §
11

Case 4:10-cv-03350 Document 53

Filed in TXSD on 05/04/11 Page 12 of 17

307(b). Further, any substantive change to the asserted claims would mean that the ’372 patent
could not be enforced for the period before the reexamination certificate issues. Bloom Eng’g
Co. v. N. Am. Mfg. Co., 129 F.3d 1247, 1250 (Fed. Cir. 1997). In addition, amendments to the
claims could obviate TTI’s basis for its infringement contentions, assuming any claim survives
reexamination.
Even if TTI does not amend the claims, arguments it makes during reexamination will help
define the scope of the asserted claims: the principle that a patentee “after relinquishing subject
matter to distinguish a prior art reference asserted by the PTO during prosecution ‘cannot during
subsequent litigation escape reliance by the defendant upon this unambiguous surrender of
subject matter’” applies to statements made during reexamination. Spectrum Int’l, Inc. v. Sterlite
Corp., 164 F.3d 1372, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (citing Southwall Techs. Inc. v. Cardinal IG Co., 54
F.3d 1570, 1578, (Fed. Cir. 1995)).
Moreover, even if the reexamination does not result in the cancellation or amendment of all
claims of the ’372 patent, the record of reexamination would likely be entered at trial and
potentially reduce the complexity and length of the litigation. The actions by the PTO during
reexamination may "greatly influence the proceedings going forward" and add clarity to the
scope of the patent, as well as the scope of the prior art, thus simplifying the issues for trial.
Echostar, 2006 WL 2501494, at *4. As this Court has recognized, "a stay may be appropriate to
avoid duplicative or contradictory findings as to the patents validity."

Tesco Corp. v.

Weatherford Int'l, Inc., 722 F. Supp.2d 755, 764 (S.D. Tex. 2010).
Given the likelihood that some or all of the asserted claims will be amended or canceled, a
stay pending reexamination avoids wasting efforts on issues that will ultimately be irrelevant: “It
would be an egregious waste of both the parties’ and the Court’s resources if the Markman and

12

Case 4:10-cv-03350 Document 53

Filed in TXSD on 05/04/11 Page 13 of 17

summary judgment proceedings went forward and the claims were subsequently declared invalid
or were amended as a result of the reexamination proceedings.” Echostar, 2006 WL 2501494, at
*4. Accordingly, “[i]t makes sense to ascertain the ultimate scope of the claims before trying to
figure out whether products infringe.” Guthy-Renker Fitness LLC v. Icon Health and Fitness
Inc., 48 U.S.P.Q.2d 1058, 1060 (C.D. Cal. 1998). Conversely, without a stay, “the parties may
end up conducting a wider scope of discovery than necessary, and the court may waste time
examining the validity of claims which are modified or eliminated altogether during
reexamination. Id. See also Target Therapeutics, Inc., 33 U.S.P.Q.2d at 2023.
In its response to EDNA’s first motion to stay, TTI takes the unusual position that “[a] stay
will not simplify the case.”

TTI’s First Response at 5.

This Court has considered such

arguments and holding that:
As noted by the Federal Circuit, reexamination may result in the
elimination of most, if not all, of the issues remaining in the pending
litigation. See Gould, 705 F.2d 1340 (Fed.Cir.1983), cert. denied 464
U.S. 935, 104 S.Ct. 343, 78 L.Ed.2d 310 (1983). If not found invalid,
the reexamination will at least likely result in a narrowing and
simplifying of the issues before the Court. See Loffland Bros. Co. v.
Mid-Western Energy Corp., 225 U.S.P.Q. 886, 887, 1985 WL 1483,
at *2 (W.D.Okla. Jan.3, 1985). In addition, the technical expertise
provided by the reexamination proceeding will be helpful to the Court
on any issues that remain. See Gould, 705 F.2d at 1342.
Tesco, 2006 WL 6625915 at *2 (S.D. Tex. Nov. 9, 2006) (granting motion to stay prior to order
from PTO granting reexamination). Clearly, this Court recognizes that a stay may simplify the
issues in a number of ways, even where all claims are not found invalid. To be clear, however,
the PTO has ordered reexamination of all of the claims in the ‘372 patent.
There is no reasonable dispute that reexamination will simplify the issues. This factor
weighs in favor of a stay.

13

Case 4:10-cv-03350 Document 53

2.

Filed in TXSD on 05/04/11 Page 14 of 17

A Stay Will Speed The Pace Of Reexamination

As courts have recognized, a stay has other benefits as well; specifically, it speeds the pace
of reexamination. See Alza Corp. v. Wyeth, No. 9:06-CV-156, 2006 WL 3500015, *1 (E.D. Tex.
Nov. 21, 2006). In cases stayed pending reexamination, the PTO conducts those reexaminations
with special dispatch. See M.P.E.P. §§ 2263 and 2286(I) (e.g., reducing office actions response
period to one month when litigation is stayed). Thus, staying this litigation both avoids the risk
of inconsistent outcomes and speeds an ultimate resolution of the issues. Importantly, the
increased pace of reexamination also mitigates against the perceived prejudice described in TTI’s
First Response.

On average, reexamination proceedings are concluded in 25.6 months.

Schlather Decl.; Ex. A at 2. The faster pace pursuant to a stay in this case would only shorten
this timeframe.
C.

The Current Stage Of Discovery Favors A Stay

Turning to the third factor considered by this court—whether discovery is complete and
whether a trial date has been set—the current stage of litigation also favors a stay. Even if the
’372 patent survives reexamination with a valid claim, there is a substantial likelihood that any
such claim will include language or elements not present in the currently asserted claims. Thus,
staying litigation pending reexamination ensures that the parties will be able to conduct
discovery on all relevant issues relating to any claim surviving reexamination. On the other hand,
if a stay is denied, there is a substantial risk that both parties' continued discovery efforts will be
all for naught.
Even when there has been “a great deal of activity” in the litigation, the third factor can
weigh in favor of a stay if future discovery efforts may prove wasteful and unnecessary. See
Echostar, 2006 WL 2501494, at *4 (weighing in favor of a stay where Markman hearings had
14

Case 4:10-cv-03350 Document 53

Filed in TXSD on 05/04/11 Page 15 of 17

already been held and trial was seven months away.); see also Emhart Indus. v. Sankyo Seiki
Mfg., 3 U.S.P.Q.2d 1889 (N.D. Ill. 1987) (granting a stay where “[t]he Court recognizes that
significant, costly discovery [had] already taken place...[but] substantially no trial preparations
[had] been carried out -- there [was] no pretrial order in place and no trial schedule [had] been
set.”). Such is the case here. Because will more likely than not be amended or new claims issued
as a result of the reexamination, staying this case and conducting discovery after the PTO takes a
position on validity and claim scope would "enable the parties and the court to focus discovery in
a way that makes more efficient use of party and court resources as the case proceeds" Vivid
Techs., Inc. v. American Science & Eng'g, Inc., 997 F. Supp. 93,95 (D. Mass. 1997).
In this case, both parties have begun discovery, however, much discovery still remains.
Both parties continue to seek documents from each other and from third parties. No deposition
witnesses have been deposed. Further, the proposed trial date is more than a year away, and no
trial preparations have been carried out. In fact, the Court has yet to even construe the claims of
the '372 patent and the Markman hearing is not until August 15, 2011. Therefore, a stay could
save substantial costs for this court and both parties by avoiding wasteful and unnecessary
discovery, as in Echostar and Emhart.
In its response to EDNA’s first motion to stay, TTI complained that EDNA engaged in
dilatory tactics and therefore a stay is not appropriate. EDNA specifically and expressly denies
such allegations, but notes that any minor delays in this case pale in comparison to the year and a
half delay between TTI’s initial contact with EDNA offering a license to the ‘372 patent and the
filing of TTI’s complaint. If TTI was as truly concerned about the impact of EDNA’s position in
the market place or the impact of EDNA’s activities on TTI’s alleged “goodwill”, it could have
and should have acted more quickly to address its alleged concerns. Certainly, this “self-created

delay” of almost eighteen months does not reflect the same sense of urgency that TTI attempted
to create in its prior response. TTI’s own delay should not be overlooked.

VI.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, EDNA requests that the Court stay this litigation pending

reexamination of the ’372 patent.
