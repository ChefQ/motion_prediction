U.S. TRUSTEE’S MEMORANDUM IN
OPPOSITION TO DEBTOR’S MOTION
FOR STAY PENDING APPEAL

Debtor.

I. SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

13
14

In the Ninth Circuit, a party seeking a stay pending appeal must show irreparable harm is

15

probable and either: a) a strong likelihood of success on the merits and that the public interest

16

does not weigh heavily against a stay; or b) a substantial case on the merits and that the balance

17
18

of hardships tips sharply in the petitioner’s favor. The Debtor has not satisfied those requisites.
His motion for a stay of the Court’s order dismissing this case pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 707(b)

19

should thus be denied.

The Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1334(a) and (b), 28 U.S.C. §§ 151

and 157(a) and (b)(1), and Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8005 (requiring that motion for stay of bankruptcy

judge’s order must ordinarily be presented in the first instance to bankruptcy judge). This is a
core proceeding pursuant to § 157(b)(2).
2.

On March 20, 2012, the Court entered an order granting the UST’s § 707(b)(1)

4

motion (Docket #12) to dismiss this case as an abuse of the provisions of Chapter 7 of the

5

Bankruptcy Code. (Docket #46, hereinafter “§ 707(b) Order”). Specifically, the § 707(b) Order

6

provided this case would be dismissed unless, within 14 days, the Debtor voluntarily converted

7

his case to another Bankruptcy Code chapter.

8

3.

The basis for the § 707(b) Order was set forth in the Court’s March 19, 2012,

Memorandum Opinion. (Docket #45.) The Memorandum Opinion rejected the Debtor’s

10

argument that the IRS Standards (incorporated by Congress in the § 707(b)(2) “means test”) are
11

unconstitutional; found that the § 707(b)(2)(A) presumption of abuse arose in this case and was
12

not rebutted; and also found that case dismissal was appropriate under § 707(b)(3)(A) and (B),
13
14
15
16

because the Debtor filed his Chapter 7 petition in bad faith, and the totality of the circumstances
of his financial situation demonstrated Chapter 7 abuse.
4.

On March 29, 2012, the Debtor filed a Notice of Appeal of the § 707(b) Order.

17

(Docket #51.) That same date, he filed a Statement of Issues to be Presented in his appeal.

18

(Docket #54.) Therein, he stated the issues as “whether the Means Test of 11 U.S.C. § 707(b)(2)

19

is inapplicable since the National and Local Standards were not adopted as required by the APA,

20

whether the acquisition of a secured debt to purchase a home pre-petition renders the filing of

21
22

this case to be in bad faith under § 707(b)(3)(A) and whether the future possibility of funds for a
Chapter 13 Plan makes this filing to be an abuse under § 707(b)(3)(B).”1

23
24

25

On April 10, 2012, the UST objected to referral of the appeal to the Bankruptcy
Appellate Panel. (Docket #63.) The appeal has since been docketed by the United States
District Court for the District of Oregon, as Case 6:12-cv-00671-HO. (Docket #70.)

Also on March 29, 2012, the Debtor filed a Motion to Stay Order of Dismissal.

(Docket #53, hereinafter “Stay Motion”.) Therein, he stated only that he “move[d] the Court for

3

an Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 158(d)(2)(D) staying the dismissal of this matter pending

4

conclusion of the appeal filed herein.” On March 30, 2012, an order temporarily granting the

5

Stay Motion was entered, pending an April 19, 2012, hearing on that motion. (Docket #56.)

6

6.

In the April 19, 2012, hearing, the UST voiced opposition to the Debtor’s Stay

7

Motion. The Court then requested that the parties to brief their positions regarding that motion

8

within 21 days. Meanwhile, pending a determination of the Stay Motion, the temporary stay

9

granted by the Court’s March 30, 2012, order remains in effect.

III. LEGAL ANALYSIS
11
12

A. A stay requires probability of irreparable harm and either a strong likelihood of success
on the merits, and that the public interest does not weigh heavily against a stay; or a
substantial case on the merits, and tipping of hardships sharply in the applicant’s favor.

13

22

Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 158(d)(2)(D), appeal of a bankruptcy court order does not stay
any proceeding of the court, unless the court issues a stay pending the appeal. Such stays are
governed by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8005, which provides, in pertinent part:
A motion for a stay of the judgment, order or decree of a bankruptcy judge …
pending appeal must ordinarily be presented in the bankruptcy judge in the first
instance. Notwithstanding Rule 7062 but subject to the power of the district court
and the bankruptcy appellate panel reserved hereinafter, the bankruptcy judge
may suspend or order the continuation of other proceedings in the case under the
Code or make any other appropriate order during the pendency of the appeal on
such terms as will protect the right of all parties in interest.
The Rule 8005 reference to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7062 (governing stays to enforce adversary
proceeding judgments) is inapplicable in contested matters, which include § 707(b)(1) motions.

Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7001 (defining adversary proceedings; Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9014(c) (designating
adversary proceeding rules applicable in contested matters, but not including Rule 7062.)
A stay pending appeal is not a matter of right, even if irreparable injury might otherwise

4

result; rather, it is “‘an exercise of judicial discretion,’ and ‘[t]he propriety of its issue is

5

dependent upon the circumstances of the particular case.’” Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 433

6

(2009) (quoting Virginia R. Co. v. United States, 272 U.S. 658, 672 (1926)) (additional citation

7

omitted). A party seeking a stay bears the burden of showing the circumstances justify an

8

exercise of such discretion. Id. at 434 (citing, e.g., Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 708 (1997))

9

(additional citation omitted).

10

Discretion in deciding stay request is not ungoverned: motions to a court’s discretion are
11

motions to its judgment, which must be guided by sound legal principles. Id. (citing Martin v.
12

Franklin Capital Corp., 546 U.S. 132, 139 (2005)) (additional citation omitted). Legal principles
13
14
15

governing stays “have been distilled into consideration of four factors”: 1) whether the stay
applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; 2) whether the

16

applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; 3) whether issuance of the stay will

17

substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and 4) where the public interest

18

lies. Id. (citing Hilton v. Branskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987)).

19
20
21
22

In Nken, the Supreme Court reiterated “[t]he first two factors of the traditional standard
are the most crtical. It is not enough that the chance of success on the merits be ‘better than
negligible.’” Id. (citing Sofinet v. INS, 188 F.2d 703, 707 [(7th Cir. 1999)] (internal quotation
marks omitted in original)). “By the same token, simply showing some ‘possibility of

23

irreparable injury,’ Abassi v. INS, 143 F.3d 513, 514 [(9th Cir. 1998)], fails to satisfy the second
24

factor. … [T]he ‘possibility’ standard is too lenient.” Id. at 434-35 (citing Winter v. Natural
25

Page 4 of 12 – MEMORANDUM OPPOSING MOTION FOR STAY PENDING APPEAL

Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, (2008) (holding Ninth Circuit “possibility”
standard, for preliminary injunctions, “too lenient”)).2 “Once an applicant satisfies the first two

3

factors, the traditional stay inquiry calls for assessing the harm to the opposing party and

4

weighing the public interest. These factors merge when the Government is the opposing party.”

5

Id. at 435 (citation omitted); Leiva-Perez v. Holder, 640 F.3d 962, 970 (9th Cir. 2011).

6

While Nken raised the minimum permissible showing of irreparable harm to justify a

7

stay, “it did not disturb the overall manner in which courts balance the various stay factors once

8

they are established.” Leiva-Perez, 640 F.3d at 965. “Nken held that if the petitioner has not

9

made a certain threshold showing of irreparable harm … then a stay must not issue, regardless of

10

the petitioner’s proof regarding the other stay factors.” Id. (citing Nken). “By the same token,
11

even certainty of irreparable harm has never entitled one to a stay.” Id. (italics in original). “In
12

short, a proper showing regarding irreparable harm was, and remains, a necessary but not
13
14
15

sufficient condition for the exercise of judicial discretion to issue a stay.” Id.
In Leiva-Perez, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reasoned that “[a]lthough there are

16

important differences between a preliminary injunction and a stay pending review, discussed at

17

length in Nken, see [556 U.S. at 428-431], we do not believe they would support a balancing

18

approach for preliminary injunctions but not stays.” Id. at 966. “If anything, a flexible approach

19

is even more appropriate in the stay context.” Id. (italics in original). Because stays pending

20

appeal are typically less coercive and disruptive than injunctions, the court concluded that “the

21
22

general balancing approach used in Abassi remains in place,” with due consideration given to
how Nken affects the individual elements to be balanced. Id.

23
24
25

2

In Nken, the Supreme Court explained “[t]here is substantial overlap between” factors
governing stays and preliminary injunctions, “not because the two are one and the same, but
because similar concerns arise whenever a court order may allow or disallow anticipated action
before the legality of that action has been conclusively determined.” 556 U.S. at 434.

Regarding the first factor – a strong showing of likely success on the merits – the Ninth
Circuit deemed it clear “that to justify a stay, petitioners need not demonstrate that it is more

3

likely than not that they will win on the merits.” Id. (citing Citigroup Global Mkts., Inc. v VCG

4

Special Opportunities Master Fund Ltd., 598 F.3d 30, 37 (2d Cir. 2010) (Nken did not suggest

5

factor requires a showing that movant is more likely than not to succeed on merits)). “Insofar as

6

we have long required more on the ‘likelihood of success’ factor than what Nken rejected, we do

7

not believe Nken changed that aspect of the Abassi formulation.” Id. at 967 (citing Abassi, 143

8

F.3d at 514) (requiring a stay petitioner to show either “a probability of success on the merits” or

9

that “serious legal questions are raised,” depending on the strength of the petitioner’s showing on

10

the other stay factors)). “Regardless of how one expresses the requirement, the idea is that in
11

order to justify a stay, a petitioner must show, at a minimum, that she has a substantial case for
12

relief on the merits.” Id. at 968.
13
14
15

In Leiva-Perez, the Ninth Circuit next noted that “[w]hile Nken did not affect Abassi’s
likelihood of success prong, it did overrule that part of Abassi that permitted a stay to issue

16

upon” simply showing some possibility of irreparable injury. Id. (citation omitted). Also, while

17

“Nken did not say what ought to replace Abassi’s ‘possibility’ standard,” the Ninth Circuit

18

observed that the Supreme Court had “quoted Winter” and that “Winter, in turn, was clear in

19

holding that ‘plaintiffs seeking preliminary relief [are required] to demonstrate that irreparable

20

injury is likely in the absence of an injunction.’” Id. (quoting Winter, 129 S. Ct. at 375) (brackets

21
22

and italics in original). The court thus “read Nken’s reference to Winter in this context as
indicating” that probability of irreparable harm is necessary to satisfy the second factor of the

23

stay inquiry. Id.

Filed 05/10/12

Turning to the third and fourth factors – assessing a stay’s impact on the opposing party,
and the public interest, which merge where the government is the opposing party – the Ninth

3

Circuit explained that Nken emphasized that particulars of each individual case must be

4

considered, rather than simply assuming that the balance of hardships will ordinarily weigh

5

heavily in the applicant’s favor. Id. at 970. The court also emphasized that while the party

6

seeking the stay has the ultimate burden, “the government is obliged to bring circumstances

7

concerning the public interest to the attention of the court. Nken’s admonition that we cannot

8

base stay decisions on assumptions and ‘blithe assertion[s]’ … applies with equal force to the

9

government’s contentions in opposing stay requests.” Id. (brackets in original, internal citation

10

omitted). The Ninth Circuit then summed up its interpretation of Nken’s effect by holding that a
11

party seeking a stay “must show that irreparable harm is probable and either: (a) a strong
12

likelihood of success on the merits and that the public interest does not weigh heavily against a
13
14
15
16

stay; or (b) a substantial case on the merits and that the balance of hardships tips sharply in the
petitioner’s favor.” Id. (citing Abassi, 143 F.3d at 514).
B. It does not appear that the Debtor can establish either a strong likelihood of success
on the merits, or a substantial case on the merits.

17

Here, the Stay Motion did not state any basis for stay of the § 707(b) Order. The Stay
18

Motion is thus insufficient to warrant the relief it requested. See Abassi, 143 F.3d at 514
19
20
21

(perfunctory request for deportation stay pending review was “wholly insufficient” to meet stay
requirements, because merits of petition for review were not discussed and no potential hardships

22

were identified). The Debtor’s supplemental brief (Doc. # 72, filed May 8, 2012) asserts a

23

probability of success on the merits. The Debtor’s argument, however, appears highly unlikely

24

to satisfy the first factor of the stay analysis as discussed in Nken and Leiva-Perez.

Filed 05/10/12

In the latter case, the Ninth Circuit considered in detail what effect Nken had on the first
factor, and concluded that “[r]egardless of how one expresses the requirement, the idea is that in

3

order to justify a stay, a petitioner must show, at a minimum, that she has a substantial case on

4

the merits.” Leiva-Perez, 650 F.3d at 968. The court further explained “[a] more stringent

5

requirement would either, in essence, put every case in which a stay is requested on an expedited

6

schedule, with the parties required to brief the merits of the case in depth for stay purposes,” or

7

would require courts to attempt “to predict with accuracy the resolution of often-thorny legal

8

issues without adequate briefing and argument.” Id. at 967. “Such pre-adjudication would

9

defeat the purpose of a stay, which is to give the reviewing court the time to ‘act responsibly,’

10

rather than doling out ‘justice on the fly.’” Id. (quoting Nken, 129 S.Ct at 1757). It thus is not
11

appropriate, at this juncture, to fully brief the merits of the Debtor’s appeal.
12

Nonetheless, it bears noting that this Court’s Memorandum Opinion found bases for
13
14
15

dismissal of the Debtor’s case as an abuse of Chapter 7 under all three mechanisms established
by the 2005 amendments of § 707(b): 1) an unrebutted presumption of abuse (§ 707(b)(2)); 2) a

16

bad-faith Chapter 7 filing (§ 707(b)(3)(A)); and 3) the totality of the circumstances of the

17

Debtor’s financial situation (§ 707(b)(3)(B)). The Debtor’s Statement of Issues suggests that, on

18

appeal, he intends to simply rehash his prior positions. No authority exists, however, for his

19

arguments asserting the IRS Standards, incorporated in § 707(b)(2), are unconstitutional. Indeed,

20

in two separate cases – the instant one, and In re Wedblad, 2012 WL 245967 (Bankr. D.Or. Jan.

21
22

26, 2012) – this Court held otherwise; and the UST is unable to identify a decision in which any
other court has remotely supported the Debtor’s § 707(b)(2) unconstitutionality arguments.

23

As for this Court’s finding that the Debtor filed his petition in bad faith – by failing to put
24

unsecured creditors’ interests on even par with his own – that comports with In re Boyce, 446
25

Page 8 of 12 – MEMORANDUM OPPOSING MOTION FOR STAY PENDING APPEAL

Case 11-61683-fra13

Filed 05/10/12

B.R. 447 (D.Or. 2011), and other “bad faith” cases cited and discussed in prior briefs supporting
the UST’s § 707(b)(1) motion. Likewise, it is well-established, as also discussed in the UST’s

3

prior briefs, that a debtor’s ability to pay creditors evidences Chapter 7 abuse under the totality

4

of the circumstances. Consequently, even in the unlikely event that the Debtor were to prevail in

5

his § 707(b)(2) constitutional challenge, he would not prevail in his appeal unless he could also

6

persuade the District Court that this Court’s separate § 707(b)(3)(A) and (B) determinations

7

were also incorrect. See, e.g., In re Egebjerg, 574 F.3d 1045, 1048 (9th Cir. 2009) (even if there

8

is not a presumption of abuse, or if the presumption is rebutted, court may still dismiss petition if

9

debtor filed it in bad faith, or if totality of the circumstances demonstrates Chapter 7 abuse).

10

In sum, that the Debtor is displeased with the § 707(b) Order, without some compelling
11

basis to suggest it may well have been wrongly-decided, is insufficient to establish either a
12

strong likelihood of success on the merits, or a substantial case on the merits – one or the other of
13
14
15
16

which the Ninth Circuit has explained is necessary, post-Nken, to warrant a stay pending appeal.
C. Even were the Debtor deemed to have a strong likelihood of success on the merits, or
a substantial case on the merits, he has not shown probability of irreparable harm.
In the April 19, 2012, hearing, and in his supplemental brief, Debtor’s counsel stated that,

17

prepetition, the Debtor was at risk of losing his driver’s license, due to a traffic accident
18

judgment.3 The § 707(b) record showed the Debtor had been a route sales driver for, essentially,
19
20
21

his entire adult employment history. It thus does arguably follow that loss of his driver’s license
could impose an employment hardship. However, even assuming the Debtor would, if the

22

§ 707(b) Order were not stayed, have his license suspended, he has yet to show 1) that he would,

23

as a result, definitively lose his job (and could not obtain another); or 2) that there would not be

avenues available to reinstate his license and/or otherwise mitigate hardship imposed by its loss.
By definition, if a license suspension were not permanent, resulting harm would not be

3

“irreparable.” In particular, the Debtor has not shown (or addressed) whether he could qualify

4

for a hardship driver’s license under O.R.S. 807.240 even if his license is suspended.4

5

In addition, any allegation of probability of irreparable harm – the standard imposed by

6

Nken’s overruling of Abassi’s “possibility” standard – to the Debtor must fail due to a glaring

7

fact: the § 707(b) Order offered him a stay alternative. That order delayed case dismissal for 14

8

days, to allow the Debtor the opportunity to convert it to another chapter. Per the March 30,

9

2012, temporary stay – still in effect, pending resolution of the Stay Motion – that opportunity

10

remains. Under 11 U.S.C. § 109 guidelines, the Debtor is eligible to be a debtor under Chapter
11

11 or Chapter 13. Consequently, discretionary judicial stay of the § 707(b) order, pending
12

appeal, simply is not necessary to avoid suspension of the Debtor’s driver’s license, because
13
14
15

conversion would continue the 11 U.S.C. § 362 automatic stay.
Debtor, however, alleges in his supplemental brief that, if he converts to chapter 13, he

16

will be irreparably harmed because he will have to make payments under a plan and that, once

17

those payments are disbursed to creditors, he could not retrieve them. At this point, it is

18

unknown what, precisely, a chapter 13 plan would provide, whether there will be any objections

19

filed, whether or when it will be confirmed, and whether any of those things will happen before

20

22
23
24

4

O.R.S. 807.240 appears to provide for the issuance of a license that would allow the
Debtor to drive for employment purposes unless he is required to drive a “commercial motor
vehicle” which is defined, at ORS. 801.208 as: “a motor vehicle or combination of motor
vehicles and vehicles that: (a) Has a gross combination weight rating of 26,001 pounds or more,
inclusive of a towed unit or a combination of towed units, with a gross vehicle weight rating of
more than 10,000 pounds; (b) Has a gross vehicle weight rating of 26,001 pounds or more; (c) Is
designed to transport 16 or more persons, including the driver; or (d) Is of any size and is used in
the transportation of hazardous materials.”

this appeal is decided. His contention that he will be irreparably harmed by converting to
chapter 13 is, therefore, too speculative to be a factor at this juncture.5
In sum, the Debtor has not shown that he will be irreparably harmed absent a
discretionary judicial stay of the § 707(b) order, pending appeal.
D. The public interest in not allowing abusive cases to continue in Chapter 7 weighs
heavily against granting the Stay Motion.

6

As discussed above, where the government is the opposing party, stay inquiry factors
7
8
9

three and four – potential damage to the opposing party, and the public interest – merge. Nken,
556 U.S. at 435; Leiva-Perez, 640 F.3d at 970. “Congress enacted the Bankruptcy Abuse

10

Prevention and Consumer Prevention Act of 2005 … to correct perceived abuses of the

11

bankruptcy system.” Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz, P.A. v. United States, 559 U.S. – , – , 130

12

S.Ct. 1324, 1329 (2010). In particular, Congress adopted the § 707(b)(2) means test “to help

13

ensure that debtors who can pay creditors do pay them.” Ransom v. FIA Card Services, NA, 131

14

S. Ct. 716, 721 (2011) (emphasis in original) (citations omitted). The public interest, as codified

15
16

in § 707(b) and as explained by the Supreme Court, thus lies in ensuring that cases deemed
abusive of Chapter 7, under mechanisms Congress provided to determine such abuse, do not

17

continue under that Bankruptcy Code chapter.
18

That in mind, because 1) the Debtor has a readily available alternative to a discretionary
19
20
21
22
23
24
25

stay of the § 707(b) Order (thereby negating any probability of irreparable harm, were the order
not stayed); because 2) his case was found abusive under all three § 707(b) mechanisms for
5

Moreover, subject to the Court’s approval (and, of course, potential objections by
interested parties), the Debtor could propose, in his chapter 13 plan, that the chapter 13 trustee
hold disbursements to creditors until this appeal is decided. The plan process could, therefore,

he could seek dismissal of the chapter 13 and obtain a refund of the payments made.
