Case 1:04-cv-00831-SLR Document54 ~~ Filed 07/20/2005 Page 6 of 25

NATURE AND STAGE OF PROCEEDINGS

Plaintiff Paul Kuck filed this purported securities class action complaint against
VERITAS Software Corporation ("VERITAS"), Gary L. Bloom and Edwin J. Gillis on
July 7, 2004, one day after VERITAS announced that it expected to fall short of its
previously issued revenue forecast for the quarter ended June 30, 2004.

Several related lawsuits were filed shortly thereafter, and, on March 3, 2005, this
Court consolidated these lawsuits and appointed Tay Siew Choon and Mark Leonov as
Co-Lead Plaintiffs. On May 27, 2005, plaintiffs filed the Consolidated Amended Class
Action Complaint ("CAC") against VERITAS, Mr. Bloom, Mr. Gillis and John Brigden
(collectively, "defendants"). In addition to the original forecast allegations, plaintiffs'
CAC extends the putative class period back a whole year to claim that each of
VERITAS' financial statements filed between April 23, 2003 and April 21, 2004 was
false because defendants had recognized revenue improperly on sales transactions.

Defendants hereby move to dismiss the CAC for failure to satisfy the heightened
pleading requirements imposed by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
(the "Reform Act") and Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) and for failure to state a claim pursuant to

Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).
Case 1:04-cv-00831-SLR Document54 ~~ Filed 07/20/2005 Page 7 of 25

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

1. With respect to plaintiffs' forecast allegations, both the Reform Act and
the "bespeaks caution" doctrine shield defendants from liability for forward-looking
statements accompanied by meaningful cautionary language. VERITAS' forecasts for
the June 2004 quarter were forward-looking because they were "a projection of
revenues." 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 78u-5(i). VERITAS accompanied these forecasts with warnings
that its quarterly revenue and earnings could be affected by "the possibility that our
customers may cancel, defer or limit purchases as a result of reduced information
technology budgets or weak and uncertain economic and industry conditions." This
cautionary language amply warned investors of the precise risks that ultimately
materialized in the June 2004 quarter, namely weakness in enterprise software sales.
Thus, defendants are shielded from liability for issuing these forecasts.

2. Plaintiffs also have failed to adequately allege that VERITAS' forecasts
were false when made. Plaintiffs premise their allegations almost entirely on post-class
period statements made in a July 27, 2004 securities analyst conference call in which Mr.
Bloom explained the factors he believed contributed to the quarterly shortfall. Plaintiffs
allege, without basis, that defendants were aware of these factors and knew they rendered
the forecasts false at the time they were issued. Plaintiffs' contentions are nothing more
than fraud-by-hindsight pleading, a tactic the Third Circuit has repeatedly rejected as a
basis on which to claim securities fraud. Plaintiffs also rely on the vague accounts of a
few alleged former employees to substantiate their forecast allegations, but none of their
accounts is linked to the reasons for the revenue shortfall. Not only do these individuals

fail to support plaintiffs' theory of fraud, but also none of them is alleged to have held a
Case 1:04-cv-00831-SLR Document54 ~~ Filed 07/20/2005 Page 8 of 25

position which would allow him or her to obtain information relating to VERITAS'
revenue projections.

3. Instead of facts demonstrating "actual knowledge" on the part of
defendants - the scienter standard applicable to forward-looking statements - plaintiffs
impermissibly allege scienter by virtue of defendants' positions and purported access to
information. Numerous courts, including those in the Third Circuit, have rejected this
generalized allegation as a basis on which to plead securities fraud. Further, given that
none of the individual defendants sold any stock during the three-month period between
the day guidance for the quarter ended June 2004 was first disseminated and the day the
quarterly shortfall was announced, no motive has been or could be pleaded.

4. With respect to the allegations regarding revenue recognition, plaintiffs
fail to plead the required element of loss causation. The Supreme Court recently
confirmed what this Circuit has already recognized: to state a securities claim under
Section 10(b), plaintiffs must allege a proximate, causal connection between the
purported misrepresentation and the subsequent decline in the price of a stock. Plaintiffs
contend that VERITAS' financial statements were false because they contained revenue
from contracts which were either unsigned or lacked essential terms. Plaintiffs, however,
allegedly incurred their losses as a result of the July 6, 2004 announcement of the
quarterly shortfall. This announcement did not address revenue recognition, let alone the
accuracy of VERITAS' prior financial statements. Plaintiffs' losses, therefore, could not
have been caused by any alleged improper revenue recognition as a matter of law.
Plaintiffs' failure to plead loss causation disposes of their accounting allegations in their

entirety.
Case 1:04-cv-00831-SLR Document54 ~~ Filed 07/20/2005 Page Qof 25

5. Plaintiffs' revenue recognition allegations also fail to satisfy the Reform
Act's heightened pleading requirements or Rule 9(b). Plaintiffs fail to plead any specific
dates, names, transactions or even the amount by which revenue was allegedly
overstated. Plaintiffs rely principally on the account of an alleged former employee in
the legal department who left VERITAS in 2003. This individual claims that Mr.
Brigden, the General Counsel, approved contracts that had not been signed or which
lacked essential terms, knowing they would be recognized as revenue. Plaintiffs fail to
allege this individual's job title, the nature of his or her responsibilities, or any basis from
which to infer that he or she would have reliable information relating to the consequences
of Mr. Brigden's review or the timing of revenue recognition. Moreover, plaintiffs
cannot satisfy the pleading requirements with this individual's account since he or she
fails to allege the name of a single contract whereby revenue was recognized absent a
required signature or material term.

6. Plaintiffs also fail to allege facts raising a strong inference that defendants
acted with deliberate recklessness in recognizing revenue. Plaintiffs fail to allege a basis
on which this individual could have knowledge of what Mr. Brigden knew when he
supposedly approved these unspecified contracts. Rather, plaintiffs attempt to satisfy
their statutory obligation to allege scienter with particularity by pointing to stock sales
executed in 2003 and early 2004 by the other defendants. Mr. Brigden, however, did not
sell any VERITAS stock. This alone negates any inference of fraudulent intent. In
addition, plaintiffs fail to allege that Messrs. Bloom's and Gillis's sales were unusual or
suspicious in timing or amount. Indeed, Mr. Bloom sold only 1.71% of his total

stockholdings (including stock options exercisable within 60 days), and Mr. Gillis sold
Case 1:04-cv-00831-SLR Document54 ~~ Filed 07/20/2005 Page 10 of 25

34% of his total stockholdings. VERITAS publicly disclosed, however, that both
individuals had entered into pre-designed 10b5-1 stock trading plans, the existence of
which negates an inference of fraudulent intent as a matter of law.

In light of the foregoing, discussed in greater detail below, defendants respectfully

request that the CAC be dismissed.
