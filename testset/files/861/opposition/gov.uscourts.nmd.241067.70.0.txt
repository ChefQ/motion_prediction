IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO
PHILLIP MOCEK,
Plaintiff,
vs.

CASE NO. 2011-CV-1009 JB/KBM

CITY OF ALBUQUERQUE, et al.,
Defendants.
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR COURT TO TAKE JUDICIAL NOTICE OF
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE’S STATEMENT OF INTEREST IN
GARCIA V. MONTGOMERY COUNTY, MD
Plaintiff Phillip Mocek, through his undersigned attorney, moves this Court to
take judicial notice of the Department of Justice’s Statement of Interest filed in Garcia v.
Montgomery County, MD, No. 8:12-cv-03592 (D.Md.) in support of his opposition to the
City of Albuquerque’s Motion to Dismiss Mocek’s Complaint. Statement of Interest
attached as Exhibit 1.
In Garcia, supra, the United States Department of Justice filed a Statement of
Interest (“SOI”) on March 4, 2013, urging the Court to hold that “individuals have a First
Amendment right to record police officers in the public discharge of their duties, and . . .
officers violate individuals’ Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights when they seize
such recordings without a warrant or due process.” SOI, p. 1. The Department filed a
similar statement in Sharp v. Baltimore City Police Dept., et al., No. 1:11-cv-02888 (D.
Md.). The DOJ specifically addressed the filing of charges against a person recording
officers in public, such as loitering, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest as being
suspect because they “are all too easily used to curtail expressive conduct or retaliate
against individuals for exercising their First Amendment rights.” The issues in Garcia

are almost identical to those in the case at bar, in which the DOJ took the opposite
position. The DOJ’s statement is directly on point to Mocek’s claims.
Plaintiff believes this Court should be aware of this important policy discussion as
it relates to Mr. Mocek’s claims.
Wherefore, Plaintiff moves this Court to take judicial notice of the Department of
Justice’s Statement of Interest in Garcia v. Montgomery County, MD, and for all other
relief that law and justice allow.
