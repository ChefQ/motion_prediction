GOVERNMENT’S MOTION IN LIMINE TO BAR
REFERENCE TO AND ADMISSION OF PUBLISHED NEWSPAPER ARTICLES
The United States of America, by and through William M. Welch II, Senior Litigation
Counsel, and John P. Pearson, Trial Attorney, Public Integrity Section, Criminal Division, United
States Department of Justice, respectfully moves this Court for an order barring any reference to
or admission of certain newspaper articles about NSA published by Reporter A.
This is an illegal documents retention case. Disclosure of classified information is not an
essential element of the charged offenses. Therefore, the content of certain newspaper articles
published by Reporter A are not relevant because they neither prove nor disprove any essential
element of the charged offenses. Finally, the content of the published newspaper articles contain
multiple levels of hearsay from multiple sources, and are inadmissible under the Rules of
Evidence.
I.

The Content Of The Published Newspaper Articles Is Irrelevant Because Disclosure
Is Not An Essential Element OF the Charged Crimes.
Title 18, United States Code, Section 793(e) provides in pertinent part that:
(e) Whoever having unauthorized possession of, access to, or control over any
document . . . willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it to an officer or
employee entitled to receive it . . ..” (emphasis added)

Case 1:10-cr-00181-RDB Document 55

shall be guilty of an offense against the United States.
By its clear statutory terms, the elements of a substantive violation of Section 793(e) are
as follows:
1.

the defendant had possession or control over documents relating to the
national defense of the United States;

2.

the defendant’s possession of the same documents was unauthorized; and,

3.

the defendant willfully retained the same documents and failed to deliver
the documents to an officer and employee of the United States entitled to
receive them.

See also United States v. Ford, Criminal No. 05-0235-PJM.
The content of Reporter A’s published newspaper articles are not relevant to the charged
crimes because disclosure is not an essential element. The content of the published articles
reflected what Reporter A, and presumably Reporter A’s editors, deemed appropriate for
publication. And that content is nothing more than a distillation of multiple pieces and sources
of information gathered by Reporter A, and the subsequent decisions by Reporter A and Reporter
A’s editors regarding what information should remain in and what information should be edited
out of the articles. Those decisions and the topics contained therein have absolutely no relevance
to the proof of any of the essential elements of the charged crimes.
Moreover, the defendant’s illegal retention of any classified documents for the benefit of
Reporter A had to have occurred before the publication of the newspaper articles. Assuming
arguendo that any portion of any classified document illegally retained by the defendant had been
published in any of Reporter A’s newspaper articles, Reporter A had to have received that
information before the publication of the newspaper articles. Common sense dictates that it

Case 1:10-cr-00181-RDB Document 55

would be impossible for the content of the published newspaper articles to be relevant to any of
the charged crimes because the published newspaper articles would not have existed at the time
of the commission of those crimes.
To be clear, the content of the published newspaper articles is distinct and separate from
any evidence relating to the defendant’s efforts to remove information from NSA for the specific
purpose of giving that information to Reporter A. That the defendant researched topics within
NSA and removed documents from NSA for the specific purpose of assisting Reporter A is
evidence of willfulness. That evidence demonstrates that the defendant was removing classified
documents from NSA intentionally, and not because of accident, mistake or negligence. It is the
content of the published newspaper articles that is irrelevant to the issues in this case.
II

The Content Of The Published Newspaper Articles Is Inadmissible Because
The Articles Contain Multiple Levels Of Hearsay.
Authentication is a “condition precedent to admissibility,” and “is satisfied by evidence

sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.”
Fed.R.Evid. 901(a). Even when a book or newspaper article has been properly authenticated,
third party statements made to reporters and later published in books or newspaper articles are
inadmissible hearsay absent a proper hearsay exception. See e.g. United States v. Resnick, 594
F.3d 562, 570 n. 4 (7th Cir.2010)(holding that book excerpts were certainly hearsay); United
States v. Baker, 432 F.3d 1189, 1212 n.23 (11th Cir. 2007)(Miami Herald newspaper article
regarding identity of gunmen inadmissible as double hearsay of reporter’s account of what
eyewitnesses stated); Horta v. Sullivan, 4 F.3d 2, 8 (1st Cir. 1993)(newspaper article contained
double hearsay and was inadmissible). Thus, to be admitted for their truth, statements found

3

within a book or newspaper or magazine article must be the admissions of a party-opponent,
adopted or authorized admissions, or some other hearsay exception. See e.g. Abruzzi Foods, Inc.
v. Pasta & Cheese, Inc., 986 F.2d 605, 606 (1st Cir. 1993)(citations omitted)(hearsay exceptions,
such as admission of party-opponent or adopted admission, required before admitting the
contents of magazine article); Penguin Books U.S.A., Inc. v. New Christian Church of Full
Endeavor, Ltd, 262 F.Supp.2d 251, 258-59 (S.D.N.Y 2003)(book written by co-founder of
church admissible as adopted admission of organization).
In Larez v. City of Los Angeles, 946 F.2d 630, 641 (9th Cir. 1991), the Ninth Circuit held
that the district court committed reversible error by admitting into evidence five statements from
Robert Gates, the former police chief for the City of Los Angeles, contained within three
newspaper articles. The Court concluded
that the statements were erroneously admitted hearsay, and that
their admission was not harmless. While defense counsel
requested that the Larezes put the reporters on the stand, and while
the Larezes were apparently prepared to do so, the court
unfortunately believed such a step unnecessary. Here, it erred.
Id. at 642. While recognizing that Gates’ actual out-of-court statements were admissions of a
party-opponent or proof of state of mind, the court stated that their repetition in the newspapers
created a difficult problem that the district court did not address.” Id. The Court reasoned that
[f]irst, the reporters’ transcriptions were out-of-court statements.
By attributing quotations to Gates, the reporters necessarily made
the implicit statement, “Gates said this!” As the reporters’
statements were made in newspapers, they were, a fortiori,
statements made out-of-court where they were not subject to the
rigors of cross-examination. Second, the statements -“Gates said
this!”- were offered for the truth of the matter asserted: that Gates
did in fact make the quoted statement.

Id.
Even under Fed.R.Evid. 803(24), the Larez court found, the statements were still
inadmissible because Rule 803(24) contained a “best evidence” requirement and “the newspaper
quotations were not the best available evidence of what Gates said; testimony from the reporters
themselves would have been better.” Id. at 644. Therefore, according to the Ninth Circuit, “the
error was the failure to take testimony from, and particularly to allow the cross-examination of,
the reporters who repeated Gates's comments.” Id.
Assuming arguendo proper authentication of Reporter A’s published newspaper articles,
Reporter A’s published newspaper articles are inadmissible hearsay. The articles contain
multiple levels of hearsay. The published newspaper articles are the statements of Reporter A
about the statements of others. Moreover, the published newspaper articles contain the
statements of multiple sources, none of whom are identified and all of whom individually are a
distinct and separate source of hearsay. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, the published
newspaper articles of Reporter A are hearsay and inadmissible.
III.

Conclusion
Based upon the foregoing, the United States respectfully requests that the Court grants its

motion and enter an order barring any reference to or admission of certain newspaper articles
