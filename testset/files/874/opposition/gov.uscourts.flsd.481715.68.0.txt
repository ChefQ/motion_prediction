COUNTER-PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO COUNTER-DEFENDANTS’
MOTION TO DISMISS SECOND AMENDED COUNTERCLAIMS
Counter-Plaintiffs Industrial Heat, LLC (“Industrial Heat”) and IPH International, B.V.
(“IPH”) (collectively, “Counter-Plaintiffs”) hereby respectfully oppose Counter-Defendants
Andrea Rossi (“Rossi”) and Leonardo Corporation’s (“Leonardo”) (collectively, “CounterDefendants”) Motion to Dismiss Defendants’ [Second] Amended Counterclaims against
Plaintiffs ([D.E. 56]) (“Motion to Dismiss”). The relevant pleading for purpose of the Motion to
Dismiss is the Second Amended Answer, Additional Defenses, Counterclaims and Third-Party
Claims (“2nd Amended AACT”). [D.E. 50].
LEGAL STANDARD
Counter-Defendants’ depiction of the applicable legal standard is inaccurate or
incomplete in several respects. First, Counter-Defendants mischaracterize the applicable
pleading standard by implying that if they can dream up potential alternative explanations for
events pled in the 2nd Amended AACT, based on assumed or hypothetical “facts” not pled in the
2nd Amended AACT, then those events cannot support claims against Counter-Defendants
because the events only create a “mere possibility” of liability. See Mot. to Dismiss at 4, 7. The
correct standard, however, is that for a party to state a plausible claim for relief, the party need
only “‘plead factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the
[opposing party] is liable for the misconduct alleged.’” Ashmore v. F.A.A., 2011 WL 3915752,
at *1 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 2, 2011) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)).
Second, Counter-Defendants fail to address that, in ruling on a motion to dismiss, a court
considers not only the allegations in the relevant pleading (here, the 2nd Amended AACT), but
also the exhibits attached thereto (and documents referenced therein that are central to a claim).
See Geter v. Galardi South Enters., Inc., 43 F.Supp.3d 1322, 1328 (S.D. Fla. 2014); Rodriguez v.

Case 1:16-cv-21199-CMA Document 68 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/17/2016 Page 7 of 19

Holder, 2011 WL 2911927, at *1 n.5 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 9, 2011); Prestige Rests. & Entm’t, Inc. v.
Bayside Seafood Rest., Inc., 2010 WL 680905, at *3 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 23, 2010); Garcia v. United
Auto Credit Corp., 2008 WL 141579, at *1 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 11, 2008).1
ARGUMENT
I.

Count I States a Breach of Contract Claim.
A.

Industrial Heat Has Standing to Bring the Count I Breach of Contract Claim

Counter-Defendants erroneously contend that, due to the Assignment and Assumption of
the License Agreement (the “Original Assignment”), Industrial Heat lacks standing to bring the
Count I breach of contract claim. “In construing assignments, the court must determine . . .
exactly what has been assigned to make certain that the [assignee] is the real party in interest[.]”
Univ. Creek Assocs., II, Ltd. v. Boston Am. Fin. Group, Inc., 100 F.Supp.2d 1337, 1339 (S.D.
Fla. 1998). “Like any other contract, the scope of the assignment depends foremost upon the
language of the agreement itself.” Sanctuary Surgical Ctr., Inc. v. Conn. Gen. Life Ins. Co., Inc.,
2012 WL 28263, at *3 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 5, 2012). “If the terms of the assignment are qualified,
then the assignment may be construed as being limited by its terms[.]” Slip-N-Slide Records,
Inc. v. TVT Records, LLC, 2007 WL 3232270, at *4 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 31, 2007) (citing State Farm
Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Gonnella, 677 So.2d 1355 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1996)).
Counter-Defendants’ argument is premised on the Original Assignment, but they wholly
ignore the Amended and Restated Assignment and Assumption of License Agreement
1

Counter-Defendants also proclaim that they are not contesting in their Motion the 2nd
Amended AACT’s allegations, see Motion to Dismiss at 2 n. 1, but then misstate what is pled in
the 2nd Amended AACT. For example, contrary to what Counter-Defendants claim in the
Motion to Dismiss, the 2nd Amended AACT does not plead that (a) the measurements of the
Plant operated in Florida were “conducted by a mutually agreed upon independent third party
expert”, (b) the validation test in 2013 was “successful[]”, (c) the operation of the Plant in
Florida was a “Guaranteed Performance” process under the License Agreement, or (d) CounterPlaintiffs approved the methodologies used to operate and measure the Plant in Florida.
Compare 2nd Amended AACT at pp. 36-38, 43-51 with Mot. to Dismiss at 1, 3-4.

Case 1:16-cv-21199-CMA Document 68 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/17/2016 Page 8 of 19

(“Amended Assignment”), attached as Exhibit 27 to the 2nd Amended AACT. The Amended
Assignment makes clear that “the Plant [i.e., the 1MW E-Cat Unit or Plant] is excluded from
such transfer and assignment and shall remain the property of the Assignor [Industrial Heat].”
Amended Assignment § 2. As the Plant was excluded from the Assignment, Industrial Heat may
still enforce the License Agreement as it pertains to Industrial Heat’s property and ownership
rights in the Plant. See State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Ray, 556 So.2d 811, 813 (Fla. Dist. Ct.
App. 1990) (“[A]n unqualified assignment transfers to the assignee all the interest of the assignor
under the assigned contract, [and] the assignor has no right to make any claim on the contract
once the assignment is complete, unless authorized to do so by the assignee.”) (emphasis added).
See also Esys Latin Am., Inc. v. Intel Corp., 925 F.Supp.2d 1306, 1312 (S.D. Fla. 2013) (“The
plain and unambiguous language of this statement [in the assignment] indicates the [first
agreement] is independent of the [second agreement] and remains in effect between the two
original signatories. Because the ‘plain language’ controls, the [first agreement] was not
assigned, but rather reaffirmed in the [assignment].” (internal citations omitted)); Slip-N-Slide
Records, Inc., 2007 WL 3232270, at *4. Cf. Leesberg Cmty. Cancer Ctr. v. Leesburg Reg’l Med.
Ctr., 972 So.2d 203, 206 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2007) (“‘An assignment is a transfer of all the
interests and rights to the thing assigned.’” (quoting Lauren Kyle Holdings, Inc. v. HeathPeterson Constr. Corp., 864 So.2d 55, 58 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2004) (emphasis added)).
Industrial Heat’s property and ownership rights in the Plant are implicated by Count I
because, among other things, that Count seeks return of the initial $1.5 million payment to
Leonardo (as well as the subsequent $10 million payment and other payments), see 2nd Amended
AACT at pp. 26-27, 52, and the License Agreement is clear that the initial $1.5 million covered
payment in full for the Plant. See License Agreement §§ 3.1, 3.2(a), 4. The License Agreement

-3-

Case 1:16-cv-21199-CMA Document 68 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/17/2016 Page 9 of 19

is also clear that Leonardo must refund that payment if “validation” under the License
Agreement was not achieved (with the Plant being returned to Leonardo). See id. § 3.2(a). Thus,
Industrial Heat, which was still the owner of the Plant following the Amended Assignment, is
entitled to enforce the License Agreement and seek recovery of the $1.5 million payment sought
under Count I. See Esys Latin Am., Inc., 925 F.Supp.2d at 1312; Slip-N-Slide Records, Inc.,
2007 WL 3232270, at *4; State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 556 So.2d at 813.
B.

Count I States a Cause of Action for Breach of Contract.

Counter-Defendants’ argument that Counter-Plaintiffs have failed to state a cause of
action for breach of contract in Count I is without merit. Counter-Plaintiffs have pled that there
are only three possible explanations for their inability to replicate the results claimed by CounterDefendants and Fabio Penon. See 2nd Amended AACT at pp. 28-29, 52. Counter-Defendants
refuse to accept these allegations, and instead dream up alternative theories that are not based on
any facts pled in the 2nd Amended AACT. See Mot. to Dismiss at 7. In fact, CounterDefendants’ theories are contradicted by the 2nd Amended AACT, which makes clear several
times that Counter-Plaintiffs used the E-Cat technology provided to them by Leonardo and Rossi
(not that they misused it or used only part of it, as Counter-Defendants hypothesize). See 2nd
Amended AACT at pp. 28-29, 41-42, 52.2 That pleading also alleges that Counter-Plaintiffs
were unable to replicate Counter-Defendants’/Penon’s claimed results even when Rossi was
working with them in North Carolina to attempt to do so. See id. at pp. 40-41, 42, 52. Because
the allegations as pled in the 2nd Amended AACT must be accepted as true, Counter-Defendants’

2

Counter-Defendants also argue that Counter-Plaintiffs do not allege in Count I the “specific
provisions of the License Agreement” that were breached. Mot. to Dismiss at 6. But the 2nd Amended
AACT very clearly identifies the validation and IP transfer provisions of the License Agreement, see 2nd
Amended AACT at pp. 51-52, and the License Agreement is also attached as an exhibit to CounterDefendants’ Complaint.

-4-

Case 1:16-cv-21199-CMA Document 68 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/17/2016 Page 10 of 19

efforts to avoid or ignore those allegations must be rejected and Count I sustained. See
Guarisma v. Microsoft Corp., 2016 WL 4017196, at *2 (S.D. Fla. July 26, 2016).3
II.

Count II States a Breach of Contract Claim.
A.

Counter-Plaintiffs Have Sufficiently Alleged that Counter-Defendants
Violated the License Agreement’s Covenant Not to Compete.

Counter-Defendants erroneously argue that Counter-Plaintiffs have not sufficiently
alleged that Counter-Defendants violated the License Agreement’s covenant not to compete
because Counter-Defendants read into the License Agreement’s covenant not to compete
language or exceptions that are simply not there. Pursuant to the plain language of the License
Agreement, the covenant not to compete prohibits Counter-Defendants and any of their affiliates
from “be[ing] . . . connected in any manner with any business or enterprise (a) engaged in the
design, development, manufacture, distribution, lease, rental or sale of any E-Cat Products, or the
provision of any services related thereto or (b) which is competitive with the E-Cat Products[.]”
other than “as an officer, director, stockholder, employee, agent or consultant” of Industrial Heat
or a subsidiary. License Agreement § 13.3.
Contrary to what Counter-Defendants assert (see Mot. to Dismiss at 10), there is nothing
in Section 13.3 that limits it to the Licensed Territory. Moreover, the 2nd Amended AACT

3

Counter-Defendants also knowingly mischaracterize the 2nd Amended AACT as “acknowledg[ing] that numerous third parties have been successful in generating an energy multiplier (COP)
ranging from COP 2.6 to COP 10.85.” Mot. to Dismiss at 8. The 2nd Amended AACT is clear that the
only persons ever to have claimed a double-digit COP, or even a COP anywhere near or over 10, are
Counter-Plaintiffs and the partner in their scheme, Third-Party Defendant Penon. Swiss and Italian
scientists determined far lower COPs (below any threshold in the License Agreement), and even their
COP determinations have been subject to serious criticism. See 2nd Amended AACT at pp. 38-39, 42-43.
In any event, none of this changes or could change the results of Counter-Plaintiffs’ testing using the ECat technology as provided to them by Counter-Defendants.

-5-

Case 1:16-cv-21199-CMA Document 68 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/17/2016 Page 11 of 19

alleges (on page 29) that Counter-Defendants are based in the United States, which is included
within the Territory.4
Counter-Defendants’ contention that Counter-Plaintiffs encouraged Rossi to continue his
research and development efforts after entering the License Agreement also misses the mark.
See Mot. to Dismiss at 10. Section 13.3 is clear that such efforts would not violate its restrictions
if Rossi undertook them as, for example, an “agent or consultant” of Counter-Plaintiffs. But
Section 13.3 is violated if Rossi undertook such efforts for someone else.
Finally, Counter-Defendants argue that their activities could only violate Section 13.3 if
they were competing with IPH. Mot. to Dismiss at 10. Again, however, this fails to read the
Section fully – it applies both to a business “(a) engaged in the design, development,
manufacture, distribution, lease, rental or sale of any E-Cat Products, or the provision of any
services related thereto or (b) which is competitive with the E-Cat Products.” License
Agreement § 13.3 (emphasis added).
Counter-Plaintiffs allege that Counter-Defendants are “engaged in designing and
developing what are classified as ‘E-Cat Products’ under the License Agreement” and are doing
so “in combination with a company or companies unaffiliated with IPH.” 2nd Amended AACT
at p. 58. This is sufficient to state a violation of License Agreement § 13.3.
B.

The Court Has Sustained Counter-Plaintiffs’ Allegations that CounterDefendants Have Failed to Pay Taxes as Required by the License Agreement.

In the Court’s recent Order on Plaintiffs’/Counter-Defendants’ motion to strike (“Motion
to Strike Order”) ([D.E. 67]), the Court refused to strike, but instead sustained, the allegations in
the 2nd Amended AACT relating to Counter-Defendants’ failure to pay taxes as required by the
4

Counter-Defendants note that Leonardo has licensed the E-Cat technology in geographic areas
outside the Territory. But nothing in Section 13.3 states or implies that such licensing activity would
further allow Counter-Defendants to, for example, manage or operate a business that manufactures or
distributes E-Cat Products.

-6-

Case 1:16-cv-21199-CMA Document 68 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/17/2016 Page 12 of 19

License Agreement because those allegations support the defense of prior breach pled in the 2nd
Amended AACT. See Mot. to Strike Order at 1 (“Paragraphs 126–33 of Count II of the
Counterclaims and Third-Party Claims in Defendants’ Answer remain intact.”).
Those allegations are not pled to support a present affirmative claim against CounterDefendants, but since they are at issue in the case in any event as part of the prior breach
defense, Counter-Plaintiffs have “reserve[d] the right to assert” the allegations as an affirmative
claim if or when additional facts develop that warrant an affirmative claim for relief. 2nd
Amended AACT at p. 60. Counter-Defendants contend such facts can never develop, but the
very case they cite to support this conclusion shows that a federal tax lien can take priority over a
private party’s interest in property if the private party’s interest is not protected by a perfected
lien prior to the attachment of the federal tax lien. See Coutant v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, 2002
WL 34382737, at *5 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 27, 2002).
III.

Count III States a Fraudulent Inducement Claim against Counter-Defendants.
Counter-Defendants’ argument that Counter-Plaintiffs have not pled fraudulent

inducement with specificity required by Rule 9(b) is without merit. As to Counter-Defendants,
Counter-Plaintiffs have alleged with considerable specificity (a) precisely what statements were
made in what documents or oral representations;5 (b) the time and place of each such statement
and the person responsible for making same;6 (c) the content of such statements and the manner
in which they misled Counter-Plaintiffs (e.g., that there was a real customer in Florida who
5

Counter-Plaintiffs have alleged that Rossi, both in his individual capacity and on behalf of
Leonardo, made the specific fraudulent statements contained in the e-mail from Rossi to Tom Darden and
others attached as Exhibit 16 to the 2nd Amended AACT, as well as two fraudulent statements during
Rossi’s August 2014 meeting with Industrial Heat in North Carolina: (1) that J.M. Products, Inc. (“J.M.
Products”) was a confidential subsidiary of Johnson Matthey p.l.c. (“Johnson Matthey”) and (2) that
Johnson Matthey was interested in using the E-Cat technology in connection with a confidential
manufacturing process it wanted to operate in Florida. See 2nd Amended AACT at pp. 43-47.
6

See Footnote 5 supra.

-7-

Case 1:16-cv-21199-CMA Document 68 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/17/2016 Page 13 of 19

needed steam power for its chemical products processing; that Counter-Defendants intended to
operate the Plant to provide power to a real customer; and that Counter-Defendants intended to
seek authorizations from regulatory agencies to allow the Plant or subsequent E-Cat plants to be
used for other commercial purposes); and (d) what Counter-Defendants obtained as a result of
such fraudulent statements (the ability to operate the 1MW Plant in Florida away from
Defendants so that Plaintiffs could conduct a fatally flawed attempt at demonstrating
“Guaranteed Performance” and thus improperly claim entitlement to $89 million under the
License Agreement). See 2nd Amended AACT at pp. 43-47, 60-61; W. Coast Life Ins. Co. v. Life
Brokerage Partners LLC, 2009 WL 2957749, at *7 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 9, 2009) (citing Ziemba v.
Cascade Int’l, Inc., 156 F.3d 1994, 1202 (11th Cir. 2001)). Nevertheless, Counter-Defendants
attempt to cast the “one e-mail alleged to be made by Rossi” (Exhibit 16) as devoid of any
specific content, blatantly disregarding the numerous and specific statements contained therein,
and entirely ignore the statements Counter-Plaintiffs allege that Rossi made during the August
2014 meeting in North Carolina. See Mot. to Dismiss at 14. Plaintiffs also ignore the detailed
allegations provided to them that address their deception and manipulation in connection with
the Validation testing in 2013. See 2nd Amended AACT at pp. 36-38.
Counter-Defendants’ suggestion that Counter-Plaintiffs have not distinguished among
Counter-Defendants and the Third-Party Defendants is equally unavailing. Counter-Plaintiffs’
allegations regarding the July 15, 2014 e-mail clearly demonstrate that Counter-Plaintiffs are
attributing the statements contained therein to Counter-Defendants, not Henry Johnson
(“Johnson”) or J.M. Products, Inc. (“J.M. Products”). See 2nd Amended AACT at pp. 43-45.
Furthermore, that Counter-Plaintiffs allege that Johnson and J.M. Products made similar
fraudulent statements to Counter-Defendants in the August 2014 meeting in North Carolina does

-8-

not render such allegations insufficiently specific – Counter-Plaintiffs are in fact alleging that
Rossi (both in his individual capacity and on behalf of Leonardo) and Henry Johnson (both in his
individual capacity and on behalf of J.M. Products) made similar fraudulent statements regarding
J.M. Products. See id. at pp. 45-46.
Counter-Defendants’ arguments are ironic given that the fraudulent inducement claim in
their Complaint does not distinguish among Defendants but instead attributes alleged
misrepresentations to multiple Defendants lumped together. See Compl. ¶¶ 112-17. In any event,
the allegations supporting Counter-Plaintiffs’ fraudulent inducement claim in the 2nd Amended
AACT are detailed and clear, and the allegations regarding Counter-Defendants’ fraudulent
statements are more than sufficient to meet the heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b) and
“alert [Counter-Defendants] to the precise misconduct with which they are charged.” Leisure
Founders, Inc. v. CUC Intern., Inc., 833 F.Supp. 1562, 1575 (S.D. Fla. 1993).7
IV.

Count IV States a Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (“FDUTPA”)
Claim against Counter-Defendants.
A.

Counter-Plaintiffs Are Allowed to Bring a FDUTPA Claim and a Breach of
Contract Claim Based on the Same Conduct in the Same Action.

Counter-Defendants contend that Counter-Plaintiffs are prohibited from bringing both a
breach of contract claim and a FDUTPA claim based on the same or overlapping conduct.
Florida law is to the contrary. A claimant may bring both a breach of contract claim and a
FDUTPA claim based on the same or overlapping conduct so long as the conduct underlying the
breach of contract is itself unfair and/or deceptive. See PNR, Inc. v. Beacon Prop. Mgmt., Inc.,
842 So.2d 773, 777 n.2 (Fla. 2003) (“To the extent an action giving rise to a breach of contract . .

In the Court’s Motion to Strike Order, Defendants were directed to clarify the specific corporate
entity responsible for fraudulent misrepresentations pled in the 2nd Amended AACT. To the extent the
Motion to Dismiss is read to raise the same issue, it will be addressed and resolved by Defendants’
amendment pursuant to the Motion to Strike Order.

. may also constitute an unfair or deceptive act, such a claim is and has always been cognizable
under the FDUTPA.”); Delgado v. J.W. Courtesy Pontiac GMC-Truck, Inc., 693 So.2d 602, 609
(Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1997) (finding that economic loss rule did not apply to bar FDUTPA claim
based on a written sales contract); see also N. Am. Clearing, Inc. v. Brokerage Comp. Sys., Inc.,
666 F.Supp.2d 1299, 1310 (M.D. Fla. 2009) (holding that conduct amounting to a breach of
contract can also support a FDUTPA claim “if the conduct underlying the breach is, by itself,
unfair or deceptive” (citing PNR, Inc., 842 So.2d at 777 n.2)).
Counter-Plaintiffs’ FDUTPA claim pleads much more than a mere breach of contract –
the claim pleads in detail a deceptive and unfair scheme to mislead Counter-Plaintiffs, conceal
relevant information from them, and manipulate them. See 2nd Amended AACT at pp. 27-28,
36-38, 41-42, 43-49, 61-63. Thus, even though Counter-Defendants’ conduct in breaching the
License Agreement also supports Counter-Plaintiffs’ FDUTPA claim, the latter claim is broader
than just a simple breach of contract and involves clear and extensive allegations of deceptive
and unfair conduct. The FDUTPA claim is perfectly permissible under Florida law.
B.

Industrial Heat and IPH Have Standing to Bring a FDUTPA Claim against
Counter-Defendants.

Counter-Defendants’ argument that Industrial Heat and IPH lack standing to bring a
FDUTPA claim against them is also without merit. Even assuming that Industrial Heat
transferred all of its rights in the License Agreement to IPH (which it did not, see page 3 supra),
and even assuming IPH does not have any right to enforce the Term Sheet, Industrial Heat and
IPH would still have standing to bring a FDUTPA claim against Counter-Defendants because a
FDUTPA claim does not require the existence of contractual privity. See Fla. Stat. 501.204(1)
(2015); Nature’s Prods., Inc. v. Natrol, Inc., 990 F.Supp.2d 1307, 1322 (S.D. Fla. 2013), appeal
docketed, No. 15-11180 (11th Cir. 2015) (“‘A claim under FDUTPA is not defined by the

express terms of a contract, but instead encompasses unfair and deceptive practices arising out of
business relationships” (quoting Siever v. BWGaskets, Inc., 669 F.Supp.2d 1286, 1292 (M.D. Fla.
2009))); see also Kia Motors Am. Corp. v. Butler, 985 So.2d 1133, 1140 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App.
2008) (citing Rollins, Inc. v. Butland, 951 So.2d 860, 869 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2006) (“[I]t is well
recognized in this state that a claim for damages under FDUTPA has three elements: (1) a
deceptive act or unfair practice; (2) causation; and (3) actual damages.”). As alleged in the 2nd
Amended AACT, Counter-Defendants engaged in a variety of deceptive acts and/or unfair
practices against both Industrial Heat and IPH, and such acts and practices have caused both
Industrial Heat and IPH to suffer harm. See 2nd Amended AACT at pp. 27-28, 36-38, 41-42, 4349, 61-63.8 Therefore, both Industrial Heat and IPH have standing to bring a FDUTPA claim
against Counter-Defendants.
C.

Counter-Plaintiffs Are Not Required to Satisfy the Heightened Pleading
Standard of Rule 9(b) in Count IV, But They Do.

Counter-Defendants erroneously assert that Counter-Plaintiffs are required to satisfy the
heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b) for their FDUTPA claim. Rule 9(b)’s heightened
pleading standard, however, does not apply to FDUTPA claims. See Deere Constr., LLC v.
Cemex Constr. Materials Fl., LLC, 2016 WL 4374970, at *8 (S.D. Fla. July 26, 2016) (finding
that “[t]he requirements of Rule 9(b) do not apply to claims under the FDUTPA” because,
among other things, FDUTPA does not require the elements of fraud and it reaches deceptive
and unfair practices that need not involve fraud (quoting Gaustaldi v. Sunvest Cmtys. USA, LLC,
637 F.Supp.2d 1045, 1058 (S.D. Fla. 2009))); Sanchez-Knutson v. Ford Motor Co., 52 F.Supp.3d

The harms pled include not only the $11.5 million Counter-Plaintiffs already paid to Leonardo,
but also the transfer of the Plant to Florida to be outside Counter-Plaintiffs’ direct control, the instant
litigation, and the Counter-Defendants and Third-Party Defendants “obtain[ing] various payments from
Counter-Plaintiffs for work that one or more .. was performing not to benefit Counter-Plaintiffs, but in
fact with the goal of harming Counter-Plaintiffs.” 2nd Amended AACT at pp. 61-62.

1223, 1239 (S.D. Fla. 2014) (citing Toback v. GNC Holdings, Inc., 2013 WL 5206103, at *2
(S.D. Fla. Sept. 13, 2013) (“[T]his Court is persuaded that Rule 9(b) does not apply to FDUTPA
claims.”).
Moreover, even if such standard did apply to FDUTPA claims, Counter-Plaintiffs have
more than satisfied it by specifically alleging that Counter-Defendants engaged in a variety of
deceptive acts and/or unfair practices against both Counter-Plaintiffs, and that such acts and
practices have caused both Counter-Plaintiffs to suffer harm. They have pled extensive details
about, among other things, Counter-Defendants manipulating them into allowing the Plant to be
moved to Florida, deceiving them about J.M. Products and its ownership, manipulating the
operations of the Plant in Florida, concealing information from Counter-Plaintiffs, and
improperly charging them for services, expenses, and equipment. See 2nd Amended AACT at pp.
27-28, 36-38, 41-42, 43-49, 61-63. Counter-Plaintiffs have also alleged actual harms they
suffered as a result of these deceptive and unfair acts. See note 8 supra. Counter-Plaintiffs have
more than adequately pled a FDUTPA claim against Counter-Defendants.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, this Court should deny Counter-Defendants’ Motion to
Dismiss the Counterclaims in the 2nd Amended AACT in its entirety.
