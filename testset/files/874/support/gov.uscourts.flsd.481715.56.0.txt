Plaintiffs, Andrea Rossi (“ROSSI”) and Leonardo Corporation (“LEONARDO”), by and
through their undersigned counsel, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P., move this Court
for the entry of an Order dismissing the Second Amended Counterclaim filed by Defendants
Industrial Heat, LLC (“IH”) and IPH International, B.V. (“IPH”), and state:
I.

INTRODUCTION

On April 5, 2016, Plaintiffs ROSSI and LEONARDO were forced to commence the above
styled lawsuit as a result of, inter alia, Defendants IH and IPH’s breach of a provision of the
parties’ License Agreement which required IH (and assignee IPH) to pay to Plaintiffs EightyNine Million Dollars ($89,000,000.00). See (DE:1). The aforementioned payment `came due
after a nearly yearlong operational test conducted by a mutually agreed upon independent third
party expert. (DE:1, ¶67) (DE:50, ¶56). During such test, Defendants had two full time
representatives present at all times relevant thereto. (DE:1, ¶67) (DE:50). In and untenable third
attempt to justify their non-payment, Defendants IH and IPH filed their Second Amended
Counterclaim and Third Party claims alleging that Plaintiffs breached the License Agreement and
committed other non-contract related offenses. See (DE:50). Moreover, as a red-herring,
Defendants IH and IPH assert claims against most of the persons and/or entities involved in the
testing of the underlying licensed technology including, but not limited to, IH’s own consultant
and the independent third party expert selected by IH to evaluate the licensed technology.
(DE:50).
A plain reading of the Defendant’s Counterclaim demonstrates that the Defendants
themselves are unable to distinguish between the rights, obligations and actions of IH as opposed
to the rights, obligations and actions of IPH, its apparent alter ego. Despite Defendants’

numerous factual misrepresentations,1 Defendants claims, as alleged in the Second Amended
Counterclaim, are both factually and legally deficient and cannot stand as a matter of law.
For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs respectfully move this Court to dismiss the
Amended Counterclaims.
II.
RELEVANT FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS IN THE
SECOND AMENDED COUNTERCLAIM AND EXHIBITS THERETO
Defendants IH and IPH allege that, consistent with IH’s “guiding mission,” IH entered into
a “License Agreement” with LEONARDO and ROSSI in October 2012 related to the E-Cat device
and formula developed by ROSSI. (DE:50, ¶1-2). Pursuant to the License Agreement, IH was
granted “the exclusive right and license under the Patents and other E-Cat IP to develop,
manufacture, make, have made, use, have used, offer to sell, have offered for sale, sell, have sold,
import, and have imported all the products deriving from the E-Cat IP” in the territory limited to
the Americas, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and the Arabian Emirates. (License Agreement, §1).
The License Agreement defines the E-Cat IP as “the patents, designs, trade secrets, technology,
know-how,…products, and business plans and all other intellectual property related directly or
indirectly to energy production and conversion technologies and to the development, manufacture
and sale of products using such technologies, including the Energy Catalyzer (“E-Cat”) the
catalyzer formula used to fuel the E-Cat, the “Hot Cat” and related energy production and
conversion technologies.” Id. The total price for the granting of such license and purchase of one
E-Cat plant was One Hundred Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,500,000.00).
(License Agreement §3.1). Notably, the License Agreement was only exclusive as to the licensed
territories and recognized the existence of other licensees for different regions throughout the
world including, but not limited to, Northern Europe, Australasia, Africa, India, France, Italy,
Defendants’ factual inaccuracies are not properly considered in a Motion to Dismiss and therefore will not
be discussed herein.

Austria, Germany and Greece, to name a few. (License Agreement, Exhibit “D”).
Pursuant to the License Agreement, IH made its initial installment payment of One Million
Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000.00) in October 2012. (Defendants’ Amended
Counterclaim, DE:50, ¶4). Thereafter, on or about April 29, 2013, IH purportedly “assigned its
rights under the License Agreement to IPH.” (DE:50, ¶48). Pursuant to such assignment, IH
assigned to IPH “all right, title and interest of [IH] in and to the [License] Agreement” and IPH
represented that IPH “accepts the assignment of the Agreement and assumes all of Assignor’s
obligations under the Agreement.” (DE:50, Exhibit “7”). Notably, the Assignment and Assumption
of License Agreement did not reserve any interest in the License Agreement to IH. See Id.
Thereafter, Plaintiffs successfully completed a 24 hour validation test of the licensed technology,
and transferred “all of the E-Cat IP to Industrial Heat and IPH” in accordance with the terms of
the License Agreement. (DE:50, ¶57, 60). After the conclusion of the successful test, IH and/or
IPH paid into escrow the second installment of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00).
Following the conclusion of the validation test, the E-Cat Plant was delivered to a location
in Miami, Florida to be operated and for further testing pursuant to a separate agreement between
Plaintiffs, Defendant IH and Third Party Defendant J.M. Products, Inc., referred to as the “Term
Sheet”. (DE:50, ¶75). During the E-Cat Plant’s operations in Miami, Defendant FABIO PENON
(“Penon”) conducted the Guaranteed Performance test. (DE:50, ¶90). Inexplicably, Defendants
now m a k e t w o i r r e c o n c i l a b l e c l a i m s , ( 1 ) t h e y deny that the test carried out by
Penon was the Guaranteed Performance t o w h i c h t h e y a g r e e d u p o n , while (2)
complaining that the E-Cat Plant did not “perform up to the standards set forth in the License
Agreement” for the very same Guaranteed Performance test. (DE:50, ¶84).

Finally, in a last desperate attempt to wrongfully avoid their obligation to pay Plaintiffs
Eighty-Nine Million Dollars ($89,000,000.00), Defendants now also complain that the
“methodologies being used [by Penon] to measure those operations…were fatally flawed”
notwithstanding the fact that Defendants IH, IPH and Darden approved the now contested
methodology. (DE:50, ¶82); see also (License Agreement, §4).
LEGAL STANDARD
“To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,
accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Guarisma v. Microsoft
Corp., No. 15-24326-CIV, 2016 WL 4017196, at *2 (S.D. Fla. July 26, 2016) (citing Ashcroft v.
Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009)). “Pleadings must contain more
than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not
do.” M.C. Dean, Inc. v. City of Miami Beach, Florida, No. 16-21731-CIV, 2016 WL 4179807,
at *3 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 8, 2016) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct.
1955 (2007)(quotations omitted). “The mere possibility the defendant acted unlawfully is
insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.” Id. (citing Sinaltrainal v. Coca–Cola Co., 578 F.3d
1252, 1261 (11th Cir.2009)). As cited by Defendants, “pleadings that are no more than
conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.” See (DE:17, pg. 4) (citing Ashmore v.
F.A.A., 2011 WL 3915752, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 2, 2011) (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678)).

ARGUMENT
1.

Count I: Breach of Contract
a.

IH Lacks the Requisite Standing:

Count I of the Second Amended Counterclaim attempts to state a claim on behalf of both
Defendant IH and Defendant IPH predicated upon the Plaintiffs’ alleged breach of the License
Agreement. (DE:50, p. 50). In Florida, “[t]here are three requirements for standing: (1) injury in
fact, which means an invasion of a legally protected interest that is (a) concrete and
particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) a causal
relationship between the injury and the challenged conduct, which means that the injury fairly
can be traced to the challenged action of the defendant; and (3) the likelihood that the injury will
be redressed by a favorable decision.” McNeely v. Berk, 510-CV-682-OC-37TBS, 2011 WL
5358057, at *6 (M.D. Fla. Oct. 31, 2011). Pursuant to the Amended Counterclaim and exhibits
thereto, on or about April 29, 2013 IH assigned all of its “rights, title and interest” in the License
Agreement to IPH. (DE:50, ¶48), see also (Exhibit “7”). Notably, the Assignment and
Assumption of License Agreement executed by and between IH and IPH is quiet as to any
reservation of rights to IH of any sort. Id. As such, upon IH’s execution of the Assignment and
Assumption of License Agreement, IH was divested of any legally protected interest in the
underlying License Agreement. Accordingly, IH lacks any contractual privity, or beneficial
interest, arising from the License Agreement which is necessary to confer the standing necessary
to maintain a cause of action based upon such agreement.
It is well settled that “[a]n assignment is a transfer of all the interests and rights to the thing
assigned. Sierra Equity Group, Inc. v. White Oak Equity Partners, LLC, 650 F. Supp.2d 1213 (S.D.
Fla. 2009); see also Price v. RLI Ins. Co., 914 So. 2d 1010, 1013–14 (Fla. 5th DCA 2005)
(“[b]ecause an assignment vests in the assignee the right to enforce the contract, an assignor retains
5

200 South Andrews Avenue, Suite 600, Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33301 • (954) 566-7117

Case 1:16-cv-21199-CMA Document 56 Entered on FLSD Docket 09/29/2016 Page 11 of 25

no rights to enforce the contract after it has been assigned”). Under Florida law, “[f]ollowing an
assignment, the assignee stands in the shoes of the assignor and the assignor retains no rights to
enforce the contract at all.” Id.; Jackson v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 608-CV-753-ORL19GJK, 2008 WL 2439796, at *3 (M.D. Fla. June 13, 2008). Having divested itself of any and all
rights, title and/or interest in the License Agreement, IH lacks the requisite standing to assert an
alleged breach of such agreement. Accordingly, IH’s claims relating to Count I must be dismissed.
b.

Count I Fails to State a Cause of Action for Breach of Contract

“To state a claim for breach of contract a plaintiff must allege: (1) the existence of a
contract; (2) a material breach of that contract; and (3) damages resulting from the breach.” Burger
King Corp. v. Huynh, No. 11-22602-CIV, 2011 WL 6190163, at *5 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 5, 2011)
(internal quotations omitted). Count I of Defendants Second Amended Counterclaim fails to
state a claim because it fails to sufficiently allege specific provisions of the License Agreement
that were allegedly breached. See Abbot Labs., Inc. v. Gen. Elec. Capital, 765 So.2d 737, 740
(Fla. 5th DCA 2000). Although Count I references §3.2(b) of the License Agreement which
provides, in pertinent part, that “[o]n the date the Escrow Agent pays the $10,000,000.00 to
Leonardo, the License will commence and Leonardo and Rossi will immediately transfer, and
the Validation Agent…will deliver to the Company all E-Cat IP,” the Defendants fail to allege
that Plaintiffs did not comply with this provision. (DE:50, ¶¶93-99). In fact, rather than alleging
that Plaintiffs have breached §3.2(b) of the License Agreement, because they cannot, Defendants
merely suggest that one might conclude that Defendants’ failed attempts to replicate Plaintiffs
work could be explained if Defendants were not provided all of the E-Cat IP. Id.
Count I is entirely based upon Defendants untenable claim that “[o]nly one of three
conclusions can be drawn from the foregoing facts: 1) Leonardo and Rossi did not transfer and

deliver all E-Cat IP to Counter-Plaintiffs; 2) Validation was never achieved and Penon’s reported
COP calculations were false; or 3) both.” (DE:50, ¶97). Amazingly, Defendants further allege that
“[e]ach of these scenarios leads to only one conclusion: Leonardo and Rossi breached the terms of
the License Agreement…” (DE:50, ¶98). “The mere possibility [a party] acted unlawfully is
insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.” M.C. Dean, Inc., 2016 WL 4179807, at *3.
Notwithstanding Defendants untenable and conclusory allegation that “only one of three
conclusions can be drawn,” logic dictates that additional conclusions could just as easily be
drawn from the same set of alleged facts which do not constitute a breach of the License
Agreement by the Plaintiffs. As an example, the Court could also infer that Defendants failure to
replicate the results achieved by the independent expert could be attributable to (a) Defendants’
failure to follow the instructions and formula contained in the E-Cat IP; (b) Defendants’
intentional sabotage in an effort to avoid having to pay Plaintiffs Eighty-Nine Million Dollars;
(c) Defendants’ mere scientific incompetence; (d) Defendants’ use of substandard quality
components and materials; (e) Defendants’ failure to properly measure the energy input and
output; and/or a litany of other equally likely possibilities.
Where, as here, “the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere
possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged—but it has not “show[n]”—“that the pleader
is entitled to relief.” Iqbal at 556 U.S. 679. “Factual allegations that are merely consistent with a
defendant's liability, however, are not facially plausible.” Casey v. Florida Coastal Sch. of L., Inc.,
3:14-CV-1229-J-39PDB, 2015 WL 10096084, at *8 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 11, 2015), report and
recommendation adopted, 3:14-CV-01229, 2015 WL 10818746 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 29, 2015). The
only factual allegation set forth in support of Count I is that Defendants have been unable to
successfully replicate the results of the independent expert, the remaining allegations are mere

conjecture and speculation. See (DE:50, ¶93-99). As aptly stated by the Supreme Court in Ashcroft
v. Iqbal, “Rule 8…does not unlock the doors of discovery for a plaintiff armed with nothing more
than conclusions.” Iqbal at 556 U.S. 678–79.
Furthermore, despite Defendants’ allegation they have been unable to “generate
measureable excess energy”, Defendants freely acknowledge that numerous third parties have
been successful in generating an energy multiplier (COP) ranging from COP 2.6 to COP 10.85.
(DE:50, ¶57, 58, 68). Absent an express allegation of the nature of the alleged breach of the
License Agreement, as opposed to Defendants’ self-serving conjecture, Count I must be
dismissed for its failure to set forth facts establishing the necessary elements of a cause of action
for breach of contract.
2.

Count II: Breach of Contract (Various Provisions)
Count II of Defendants’ Second Amended Counterclaim asserts that Plaintiffs have

breached the License Agreement by (a) breaching the confidentiality provisions therein; (b)
failing to assign licensed patents to IPH; (c) failing to consult with IH or IPH regarding all Patent
Applications; (d) violating the alleged covenant not to compete, and (e) failing to pay taxes.
See (DE:50, ¶¶100-133). Despite the fact that Count II of the Second Amended Counterclaim is
replete with misstatements and factual inaccuracies, Plaintiffs only seek dismissal of claims (d)
and (e) above for the reasons set forth below.
a. Covenant Not to Compete
Defendant IPH alleges, in pertinent part, that ROSSI and LEONARDO have breached the
non-compete provision of the license agreement. Id. Specifically, Defendant IPH alleges that
“[s]ince at least the filing of their Complaint…Leonardo and Rossi have been open in
broadcasting that they are engaged in designing and developing what are classified as ‘E-Cat
Products’ under the License Agreement.” Id. at ¶122. Furthermore, Defendant IPH alleges that

Case 1:16-cv-21199-CMA Document 56 Entered on FLSD Docket 09/29/2016 Page 14 of 25

ROSSI and LEONARDO “are doing so in combination with a company or companies
unaffiliated with IPH.” Id. Assuming, arguendo, that the non-compete agreement was valid and
enforceable, and that the aforementioned allegations were true, the allegations contained in the
Amended Counterclaim fail to state a breach of the plain terms of the License Agreement.
Specifically, the terms of the non-compete agreement are as follows:
For as long as Company or any of its subsidiaries is
engaged in any business related to the E-Cat Products and
Leonardo, Rossi or any Affiliate of Leonardo own any of the
Company’s equity ownership interests or Leonardo, Rossi or any
Affiliate are performing services for the Company or such
transferee (whether as an employee, consultant or otherwise and
specifically including the period of services required by Section
13.1) and for an additional period of two (2) years after the last of
Leonardo, Rossi or such Affiliate shall have ceased to provide
such services, none of Leonardo, Rossi or any of their Affiliates
will (except as an officer, director, stockholder, employee, agent or
consultant of the Company or such subsidiary of the Company)
directly or indirectly own, manage, operate, join, or have a
financial interest in, control or participate in the ownership,
management, operation or control of, or be employed or engaged
as an employee, agent or consultant, or in any other individual or
representative capacity whatsoever, or use or permit their names to
be used in connection with, or be otherwise connected in any
manner with any business or enterprise (a) engaged in the design,
development, manufacture, distribution, lease, rental or sale of any
E-Cat Products, or the provision of any services related thereto or
(b) which is competitive with the E-Cat Products, unless Leonardo
or such Affiliate shall have obtained the prior written consent of
the Company or such subsidiary of the Company, as the case may
be. In the event of termination of this Agreement due to a breach
by the Company, the Company and all its affiliates, employees,
officers, directors, for two (2) years after the period of
effectiveness of this agreement, will not be allowed to work for a
competitor of Leonardo in the licensing or sale of products
competing with the E-Cat Products. (License Agreement, §13.3)
Defendant IPH’s sole allegation in support of its claim that ROSSI and/or LEONARDO
breached §13.3 of the License agreement is that Plaintiffs were “engaged in designing and
developing what are classified as ‘E-Cat Products.” This claim flies in the face of the clear and

200 South Andrews Avenue, Suite 600, Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33301 • (954) 566-7117

Case 1:16-cv-21199-CMA Document 56 Entered on FLSD Docket 09/29/2016 Page 15 of 25

unambiguous language of the License Agreement which clearly recognizes that (a) it was the
parties intent that ROSSI and LEONARDO continue to develop new innovative products related
to the E-Cat, and (b) ROSSI and LEONARDO were engaged in license agreements with other
companies in Northern Europe, Australasia, Africa, India, France, Benelux, Slovenia, Italia,
Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Malta, Greece, the Balkans and Cyprus. See
(License Agreement, §13.4 “After Acquired/Developed Assets, Intellectual Property Rights”); see
also (License Agreement, Exhibit D “List of Exclusive Commercial Licenses”). In fact,
Defendant IPH admits to encouraging Plaintiffs’ development, modification and testing of the ECat and various E-Cat reactors. (DE:50, ¶62). Plainly stated, there is no prohibition in the noncompete provision against Rossi’s continued research and development of the E-Cat technology.
As Defendant IPH is well aware, the License Agreement granted the licensee rights
within a very specific and limited geographic territory. (License Agreement, §2). Amazingly,
despite Defendant IPH’s geographically limited licensed territory, IPH’s knowledge of the
existence of numerous other Licensees in other territories and Defendants’ facilitation and
encouragement of further development of the E-Cat technology, Defendant IPH nonetheless
maintains that it is entitled to prevent ROSSI and LEONARDO from continuing their work
globally. Notably, Defendant IPH has not alleged, nor can it, that Plaintiffs have undertaken
any activity whatsoever in competition with Defendant IPH within the Defendants limited
geographic territory. Accordingly, Defendant IPH has failed to set forth a prima facie claim for
breach of the non-compete provision of the License Agreement and Count II as to this claim
should be dismissed.

b. Failure to Pay Taxes:
Defendant IPH’s allegations pertaining to Plaintiffs alleged “Failure to Pay Taxes”
amounts to nothing more than an improper and frivolous attempt by Defendants to cast Plaintiffs
in a bad light before the Court and otherwise defame Plaintiffs under the protection of the
litigation privilege. Even assuming, arguendo, the allegations made upon Defendant IPH’s
“information and belief” were true (they are not), for the purposes of this motion, Defendant IPH
fails to allege facts sufficient to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face. See Chandler v.
Sec. of Florida Dept. of Transp., 695 F.3d 1194, 1198–99 (11th Cir. 2012). “In order to state a
claim for breach of contract under Florida law, Plaintiff must allege: “(1) a valid contract, (2) a
material breach, and (3) damages,” as well as Plaintiffs “performance of its obligations under the
contract or a legal excuse for its nonperformance.” APR Energy, LLC v. Pakistan Power
Resources, LLC, 653 F. Supp. 2d 1227, 1232 (M.D. Fla. 2009).
As the basis for this claim, Defendant IPH relies upon its vexatious allegations that (a)
“on information and belief, Leonardo and Rossi have not paid their federal taxes on payments
made to them from Counter-Plaintiffs, and have not filed all tax returns or reports relating to
payments made to them from Counter-Plaintiffs” and (b) that “[p]rior to Leonardo and Rossi
entering into the License Agreement, it was well known that Rossi had taxation issues with the
Italian Government, which even led to him facing criminal charges in Italy. As a clear
acknowledgement that such allegations are improper and do not give rise to a cause of action,
Defendant IPH states that “Industrial Heat and IPH do not assert this breach as a basis to recover
damages… but reserve the right to assert this claim in the event a federal tax lien is issued
affecting Industrial Heat and/or IPH’s assets or rights under the License Agreement.” [DE: 50,
¶133]. There can be no doubt that such allegations, set forth in Defendant IPH’s Second

11

200 South Andrews Avenue, Suite 600, Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33301 • (954) 566-7117

Amended Counterclaim, were included for improper purposes and do not give rise to a viable
cause of action.
Despite Defendant IPH’s admission that it has not been damaged as of this time, IPH
attempts to “reserve the right” to claim damages in the event that a tax lien is issued. [DE:50,
¶133]. Even assuming, arguendo, that a tax lien could attach to the Defendants’ interest in the ECat IP at some point in the future, contrary to well settled law, such claim would be barred at this
time by the ripeness doctrine as the claim is premature. “The ripeness doctrine protects federal
courts from engaging in speculation or wasting their resources through the review of potential or
abstract disputes. Picazio v. Melvin K. Silverman and Associates, P.C., 965 F. Supp. 2d 1411,
1415 (S.D. Fla. 2013).
Notwithstanding the fact that Defendant IPH’s allegations are unripe at best, the
allegations contained in the Second Amended Counterclaim could never give rise to a cause of
action against Plaintiffs. The United States Supreme Court has made clear that a federal tax lien
does not “extend beyond the property interests held by the delinquent taxpayer.” United States v.
Rodgers, 461 U.S. 677, 690–91 (1982). The lien attaches to property that the taxpayer owns at
the time the tax liability is assessed and to property acquired thereafter. United States v. Barnes,
509 F. App'x 837, 840 (11th Cir. 2012). A tax lien is assessed “at the time liability is determined.”
In re Garcia, No. 01-945-CIV, 2002 WL 31409580, at *4 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 6, 2002). Accordingly,
“a tax lien cannot attach to any property interest that was transferred before the assessment.”
Coutant v. U.S., Dep't of Treasury, I.R.S., No. 00-14163CV, 2002 WL 34382737, at *4 (S.D. Fla.
Feb. 27, 2002). Accordingly, Defendant can never satisfy the damage element necessary to state
a claim for breach of contract based upon such allegations. The allegations and/or claims related
to the Plaintiffs alleged “Failure to Pay Taxes” were clearly made for improper purposes and the

Case 1:16-cv-21199-CMA Document 56 Entered on FLSD Docket 09/29/2016 Page 18 of 25

allegations must be dismissed as immaterial, impertinent and improper.
3. Count III: Fraudulent Inducement
Count III of Defendants’ Second Amended Counterclaim alleges that Plaintiffs and
others fraudulently induced Defendant Industrial Heat into entering into the “Term
Sheet.”(DE:50, ¶134-139). “To state a cause of action for fraudulent inducement, a plaintiff must
plead: (1) the defendant made a false statement about a material fact; (2) the defendant knew the
statement was false when he made it or was without knowledge of its truth or falsity; (3) the
defendant intended that the plaintiff rely and act on the false statement; and (4) the plaintiff
justifiably relied on the false statement to his detriment.” Persaud v. Bank of Am., N.A., 1421819-CIV, 2014 WL 4260853, at *12 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 28, 2014) (internal citations omitted).
“Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), a plaintiff must also plead the circumstances
constituting fraud with particularity.” Id. “To comply with Rule 9(b), the Eleventh Circuit requires
a complaint to set forth (1) precisely what statements were made in what documents or oral
representations or what omissions were made, (2) the time and place of each such statement and
the person responsible for making (or, in the case of omissions, not making) same, (3) the content
of such statements and the manner in which they misled the plaintiff, and (4) what the defendants
obtained as a consequence of the fraud.” W. Coast Life Ins. Co. v. Life Brokerage Partners LLC,
08-80897-CIV, 2009 WL 2957749, at *7 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 9, 2009) (citing Ziemba v. Cascade Int’l.
Inc., 156 F.3d 1994, 1202 (11th Cir. 2001)).
In the instant case, Defendant IH alleges numerous statements which Defendant IH
attributes c o l l e c t i v e l y to “Rossi, both in his individual capacity and as the representative of
Leonardo, and Johnson, both in his individual capacity and as the representative of JMP.”
(DE:50, ¶74, 75, 135, 137). With the exception of one email alleged to have been made by

200 South Andrews Avenue, Suite 600, Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33301 • (954) 566-7117

Case 1:16-cv-21199-CMA Document 56 Entered on FLSD Docket 09/29/2016 Page 19 of 25

Rossi, Defendant IH fails to specifically allege (a) the specific alleged fraudulent statements that
were purportedly made, (b) to whom such statements were made, (c) which individual and/or
entity made such statement(s), and (d) what each such individual and/or entity obtained as a
consequence of the fraud. See Id. “Where multiple parties are charged with fraud, the complaint
must distinguish among defendants and specify their respective roles in the fraud.” Leisure
Founders, Inc. v. CUC Intern., Inc., 833 F. Supp. 1562, 1575 (S.D. Fla. 1993). “It is a serious
matter to charge a person with fraud and hence no one is permitted to do so unless he is in a
position and is willing to put himself on record as to what the alleged fraud consists of
specifically. Id. Plaintiffs submit that Defendant IH has failed to meet the heightened pleading
requirements necessary to properly plead a claim for fraud, and that Count III should therefore be
dismissed.
4. Count IV: Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act
As its fourth claim against Plaintiffs, Defendants allege that Plaintiffs violated the Florida
Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (hereafter “FDUTPA”) arising from, in large part, the
same alleged facts and circumstances set forth in Count III of the Second Amended Counterclaim
for fraud. (DE:50, ¶140-148) “To establish a claim for damages under FDUTPA a plaintiff must
show three elements: 1) a deceptive act or unfair practice; 2) causation; and 3) actual damages.”
Casey v. Florida Coastal Sch. of L., Inc., 3:14-CV-01229, 2015 WL 10818746, at *2 (M.D. Fla.
Sept. 29, 2015). Where, as here, the FDUTPA claims sound in fraud, the heightened pleading
requirements of Rule 9(b) apply. Llado-Carreno v. Guidant Corp., 09-20971-CIV, 2011 WL
705403, at *5 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 22, 2011) (finding that the “particularity requirement of Rule 9(b)
applies to all claims that sound in fraud, regardless of whether those claims are grounded in state
or federal law”); see also Stires v. Carnival Corp., 243 F.Supp.2d 1313, 1322 (M.D.Fla.2002)

Case 1:16-cv-21199-CMA Document 56 Entered on FLSD Docket 09/29/2016 Page 20 of 25

(“Most courts construing claims alleging violations of the Federal Deceptive Trade Practices Act
or its state counterparts have required the heightened pleading standard requirements of Rule
9(b).”); Vess v. Ciba–Geigy Corp. USA, 317 F.3d 1097, 1108 (9th Cir.2003) (“Where, as here,
the averments in the complaint necessarily describe fraudulent conduct, Rule 9(b) applies to
those averments.”).
a. Industrial Heat, LLC Lacks Standing on Claims Relating to License Agreement.
As with Defendants’ allegations in Count I and Count II of the Second Amended
Counterclaim, Defendants again make no distinction between Industrial Heat, LLC. and IPH
International, B.V. in Count IV by simply referring to the two parties jointly as “CounterPlaintiffs”. (DE:50, ¶140). In doing so, the Amended Counterclaim purports to assert identical
claims on behalf of both entities despite the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b)
discussed more fully below. Moreover, as part of its claim, Defendant IH alleges that Plaintiffs
undertook a fraudulent scheme manipulate the results of the Guaranteed Performance test in
order to induce Defendants to pay Plaintiffs Eighty-Nine Million Dollars ($89,000,000.00) in
accordance with the License Agreement. (DE:50, ¶143-146). To the extent such claims are based
upon the License Agreement, including but not limited to allegations pertaining to the testing
and operation of the E-Cat in accordance with the License Agreement, Defendant IH lacks
standing to assert such claims as discussed in relation to Count I above. Similarly, Defendant
IPH lacks standing to raise any claims in relation to the Term Sheet as Defendant IPH was not
alleged to be a party to the Term Sheet nor a third party beneficiary thereof.

b. Count IV Impermissibly Recasts Breach of Contract Claims in Tort.
The entirety of Defendants’ claims alleged in Count IV relate to the parties contractual
dealings. In Florida, parties to a contract may not recast their breach of contract claims as tort
claims. Kaye v. Ingenio, Filiale De Loto-Quebec, Inc., 2014 WL 2215770, at *4 (S.D. Fla. May
29, 2014). The allegations contained in Count IV of the Amend Counterclaim arise from the
parties dealings pursuant to the License Agreement, Term Sheet and USQL Agreement.
(DE:50, ¶146). In fact, Defendants specifically alleged that Plaintiffs “engaged in
unconscionable, unfair and deceptive acts and practices” by “refusing to provide other
information property requested by Counter-Plaintiffs, and to which Counter-Plaintiffs were
entitled pursuant to the License Agreement, the Term Sheet, the USQL Agreement…” (DE:50,
¶146(e)). Notwithstanding, Defendants attempt to recast such contract claims as tort claims.
Count IV under the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act impermissibly sounds in
tort. See, e.g., Am. Boxing & Athletic Ass'n v. Young, 911 So.2d 862, 865 (Fla. 2d DCA 2005)
(“a tort claim under FDUTPA”); Crowley Liner Servs., Inc. v. Transtainer Corp., No. 06–
21995, 2007 WL 433352, at *5 (S.D.Fla. Feb. 6, 2007) (“The defendant's FDUTPA
counterclaim sounds in tort.”). Accordingly, Defendants’ claims must be dismissed as
Defendants are clearly attempting to improperly recast their contract claims as claims in tort
under FDUTPA.
c. Defendants Fail to Satisfy the Rule 9(b) Heightened Pleading Requirements.
Defendants’ Second Amended Counterclaim fails, as a matter of law, to plead, with the
requisite specificity, each element of the Defendants’ FDUTPA claims in that Defendants fail
to state (a) the specific facts including time, date, place and person responsible for the alleged
actions and/or inactions which Defendants’ claim were misleading, (b) how such alleged actions

Case 1:16-cv-21199-CMA Document 56 Entered on FLSD Docket 09/29/2016 Page 22 of 25

and/or statements were misleading, and (d) and any allegations as to causation connecting the
alleged misleading actions to any alleged damages. Ferrara v. LCS Fin. Services Corp., 8:14CV-2450- T-30AEP, 2015 WL 84703, at *3 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 7, 2015); see also E & C Copiers
Export Import Corp. V. Arizs Fotocopiandras S.A.S., 2015 WL 7720604, at *3 (S.D. Fla. Nov.
30, 2015). In pleading a claim under FDUTPA, it is necessary to plead not only the alleged
wrongdoing, but also facts to establish the causation between the alleged wrongdoing and the
alleged damages. Id. Defendants have failed to plead any such facts with the requisite specificity
required pursuant to Rule 9(b). Similarly, since Defendants were required to plead damages as an
element of its FDUTPA claim, Defendants unsupported allegation that Defendants “have
suffered and continue to suffer actual damages…” lacks the requisite specificity and is
insufficient as a matter of law. For the foregoing reasons, Count IV of Defendants’ Amended
Counterclaim should be dismissed.
