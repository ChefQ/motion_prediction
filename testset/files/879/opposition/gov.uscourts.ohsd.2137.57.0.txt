UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO
WESTERN DIVISION
SCOTT D. DALESANDRO and DIANE
NOONAN, on behalf of themselves and
others,
Plaintiffs,

Case No. C-1-01 109

vs.
INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY,

Judge Sandra S . Beckwith

Defendant .
DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS NOTICE
AND REQUESTED REVISIONS TO PROPOSED NOTICE
Defendant, International Paper Company, by counsel, responds to Plaintiffs' Motion for
Class Notice as follows:
1.

Defendant does not object to Plaintiffs providing notice to the class regarding

issues that have been raised as to whether claims for vacation benefits are matters in dispute, and
are potentially issues in this lawsuit.
2.

Defendant International Paper objects to the content of Plaintiffs' proposed class

notice, because

curately characterizes the vacation policy applicable to plaintiffs .

Plaintiffs' proposed notice, Exhibit A, to the Plaintiffs' motion, refers to payment "for unused
vacation that you may have banked and earned as of February 9, 2001 ." The concept of
"banked" vacation is not applicable to Plaintiffs . The question is whether Plaintiffs have "earned
but unused" vacation, for which they were not paid. Thus, to be characterized correctly, the
dispute must be referred to as a disagreement as to whether the Plaintiffs are entitled to a

payment from International Paper in this litigation for vacation earned in 2000, but not taken or
paid in 2001 .
3.

International Paper also objects to the Notice because

es that "International

Paper's position is that you are not entitled to vacation pay in this lawsuit." This does not fairly
state International Paper's position . International Paper's position is that "you received your
earned but unused vacation from Smart Papers after February 9, 2001, because Smart Papers
assumed and satisfied this obligation pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement. International
Paper also takes position that this claim has not properly been raised in this lawsuit, and it is not,
therefore, properly part of this suit."
International Paper agrees with Plaintiffs that class members are entitled to be informed
of the issues in the litigation, but International Paper believes that the position of both parties
should be explained to the class members, and not simply the position of Plaintiffs' counsel .
Undersigned counsel for International Paper regrets that he was unable to provide this
response to Plaintiffs within the time table requested by Plaintiffs' counsel . However, if the
above changes to class notice are acceptable to Plaintiffs' counsel, there is no need for the court
to rule on Plaintiffs motion.
Respectfully submitted,
INTERNATIONAL PAPER CO .
