Case No. C-1-01-109
Judge Sandra S. Beckwith

PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR
COURT APPROVAL OF CLASS
COMMUNICATION
(Exhibits & Proposed Entry attached)

MOTION
Plaintiffs move the Court to approve and authorize a letter from Class Counsel to the
class members informing them of the status of the parties’ dispute as to whether vacation pay is
recoverable in this lawsuit. The proposed communication is attached hereto as Exhibit A. The
bases for this Motion are set forth in the following Memorandum in Support, and a proposed
Entry is attached (Exhibit C) and has been sent to the Court via electronic mail in Word format.
MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT
In the Court Ordered Notice dated September 24, 2003 the class members were informed
that this action had been certified, that judgment had been entered, and that they had certain
rights and obligations related to their participation or exclusion from the action. This Notice also
included Defendant’s calculation of each employee’s severance benefits (provided by Section 2
of Policy #828), but did not include any calculation of the employees’ earned but unused
vacation pay (provided by Section 7.1 of Policy #828).

This Notice instructs the class members to review the calculation of their benefits and to
send a letter within 30 days to Defendant (Sharon Barger is the contact person provided by
International Paper) if they believe the calculation is incorrect and explaining the grounds as to
why the calculation is incorrect. More than 70 employees sent letters within the required time
objecting to the calculations based on the omission of their earned but unused vacation time that
they had earned while under Defendant’s employ.1 The Notice also stated that International
Paper Company would respond to those objections setting forth a reviewed determination and
explanation of the calculation no later than 20 days after the receipt of any such letter.
Soon after the Court’s Notice was mailed, Plaintiffs’ counsel began receiving phone calls
with questions about the omission of the vacation pay; these phone calls continued over the
weeks and have not ceased.2 Plaintiffs’ counsel has also received many copies of letters that
class members have sent to Defendant which, to date, total in excess of 70.3 Further, Plaintiffs
counsel has received multiple calls, which are increasing, from class members who have not
received the promised response from International Paper within the 20 day period stated in the
Notice.4 Plaintiffs’ counsel then contacted defense counsel to alert him to the issue, to inquire as
to Defendant’s response to the letters, and to come to an agreement on the procedure by which it
should be addressed.5 Counsel were unable to reach agreement and the parties presented the
dispute to the Court in a phone conference on October 28, 2003.6 The Court granted Defendant’s
request to conduct discovery and the dispute is in the process of being presented to and decided
by the Court.7

At the conclusion of the October 28, 2003 conference with the Court, Plaintiffs’ counsel
requested permission to send a letter to the class members for the sole purpose of informing them
of the status of the vacation pay dispute. Plaintiffs agreed to draft the letter and to submit it to
Defendant and then to the Court for review. Immediately thereafter, on October 29, 2003,
Plaintiffs sent via electronic mail the letter to the class that they intended to submit to the Court
for approval.8 That letter is attached as Exhibit A.
In that October 29 transmission Plaintiffs requested that Defendant inform them of any
revisions so that the letter could be jointly submitted to the Court.9 When, one week later on
November 5, 2003, Plaintiffs had not received any response from Defendant, they sent another
electronic message asking Defendant whether they could submit the letter and represent to the
Court that Defendant did not oppose the language; Plaintiffs also informed Defendant that they
intended to file the letter for the Court’s review in the following days on November 6 or 7 before
the end of that week.10 As of November 11, 2003, Plaintiffs have received no response to these
requests from Defendant.11
This communication is necessary based upon the number of phone calls and letters from
employees, and based upon the belief that Defendant has not sent any response to any employee
who wrote letters.12 The proposed letter is appropriate under F.R.Civ.P. 23(d)(2) and will
provide useful information in a neutral and uniform manner and ensure that the class members
are notified that their responses to the first Court Notice will be fully and fairly addressed.

Plaintiffs’ counsel has not received copies of any responses from Defendant to any employees’ letters, and has
been informed by many employees that their letters to International Paper were sent well over 20 days ago, as is
supported by the dates of those employee letters, and that they have received no response from International Paper.
