RESPONSE OF THE DANE COUNTY AND MILWAUKEE COUNTY CLERKS IN
OPPOSITION TO STATE’S MOTION FOR BURFORD ABSTENTION

The State Defendants argument for Burford abstention is not well founded. Although
only three county clerks are named as defendants, every county clerk in the state is required to

issue a marriage license if the requirements set forth in WIS. STAT §765.12(1) are met. If the
marriage ban in Article XIII, §13 of the Wisconsin Constitution is declared unconstitutional, all
Wisconsin county clerks would be required to issue marriage licenses to same sex couples if they
otherwise complied with §765.12(1).
Section 765.12(1)(a) states that “If ss.765.02, 765.05, 765.08, and 765.09 are complied
with, and if there is no prohibition against or legal objection to the marriage, the county clerk
shall issue a marriage license.” (emphasis added) Section 765.02 sets the age at which a person
can marry. Section 765.05 sets residency requirements. Section 765.08 sets a five day waiting
period for issuance of a marriage license. Section 765.09 states that a marriage license may not
be issued to persons who are already lawfully married, and specifies data and documentation that
must be presented to the county clerk, none of which pertains to gender of the person seeking to
marry. Section 756.11 sets forth the grounds for a legal objection to a marriage. They are
minority of an applicant, competency or false statements on the application. Again, gender of the
parties is not the basis for such an objection. Therefore, if the marriage ban is declared
unconstitutional by this court, all county clerks would be required to issue marriage licenses to
same sex couples if they otherwise meet the requirements set forth is §765.12(1)(a).
CONCLUSION
The State Defendants’ argument that Burford abstention should be invoked because only three
county clerks are named as defendants is a delay tactic that is not supported by either fact or law.
The Plaintiffs are correct that issuance of a marriage license by a county clerk is a ministerial act
that must be complied with if the requirements of §765.12(1)(a) are met. For that reason the
concerns raised by the State Defendants do not warrant Burford abstention.
