STATE DEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF
MOTION TO ABSTAIN AND STAY

INTRODUCTION
Since the beginning of this nation, the definition and regulation of marriage has been the
responsibility of the states, rather than of the federal government. See United States v. Windsor,
___ U.S. ___, 133 S. Ct. 2675, 2691 (2013). In the present case, plaintiffs challenge the federal
constitutionality of the State of Wisconsin’s definition of the legal status of marriage. There is
no dispute that, even in such an area of virtually exclusive state primacy, the states must comply
with the strictures of the United States Constitution.

Considerations of federalism and

federal-state comity, however, dictate that the federal courts should give state courts an

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 58 Filed: 03/14/14 Page 2 of 16

opportunity to clarify the meaning of a challenged state law before they go about the serious
business of potentially invalidating it. See Forsyth v. City of Hammond, 166 U.S. 506, 518-19
(1897) (noting that “[t]he construction by the courts of a state of its constitution and statutes is,
as a general rule, binding on the federal courts[]” and that a state’s supreme court is the “final
arbiter” of question regarding the meaning of the state’s constitution).
For this reason, the State Defendants1 ask this Court to temporarily stay the present
action, pursuant to the abstention doctrine of R.R. Comm’n of Tex. v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496
(1941), until the Wisconsin Supreme Court has issued a decision in the pending case of Appling
v. Walker, Case No. 2011AP1572. The issue in Appling is whether the legal status of domestic
partnership created by Wis. Stat. ch. 770 is substantially similar to the legal status of marriage
and, therefore, neither valid nor recognized in this state under Wis. Const. art. XIII, § 13.
Because the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s interpretation of the state-law issues in Appling will
substantially affect this Court’s analysis of the federal constitutional issues in this case, Pullman
abstention is warranted here.
In the alternative, State Defendants ask the Court to abstain pursuant to the doctrine of
Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315 (1943), because any injunctive relief issued by this Court
would be binding only on the State Defendants and the three county clerks named in plaintiffs’
Amended Complaint and not on any other state or local officials (Dkt. #26). Under these
circumstances, Burford abstention is warranted because the adjudication of plaintiffs’
constitutional claims in this forum would disrupt the state’s important interest in the uniform and
coherent administration of state marriage laws, which clearly is a matter of substantial public
concern. Accordingly, if this case is not temporarily stayed under Pullman, State Defendants ask

The State Defendants are Scott Walker, J.B. Van Hollen, Richard G. Chandler, Oskar Anderson,
Gary King, and John Chisholm.

the Court either to order Burford abstention or to direct such other steps as the Court may deem
appropriate to protect the significant state interest in the coherence of state marriage policy. If a
Pullman stay is granted, then State Defendants ask that the Burford issue be addressed prior to
any resumption of this proceeding.
ARGUMENT
I.

THE COURT SHOULD STAY THIS CASE UNDER THE PULLMAN
ABSTENTION
DOCTRINE
PENDING
THE
WISCONSIN
SUPREME COURT’S DECISION IN APPLING.
A.

Pullman Abstention Is Proper Under The Circumstances Of This
Case.

The present case should be stayed under the Pullman abstention doctrine. Under that
doctrine, a federal district court is directed to abstain from exercising its jurisdiction over
federal constitutional claims if two interrelated elements are present in the case.

Pullman,

312 U.S. at 499-501. First, there must be an uncertain question of state law, and second, that
state-law question must be susceptible of a construction that will either eliminate the need to
decide the federal question or materially alter the federal court’s view of that issue. Bellotti v.
Baird, 428 U.S. 132, 147 (1976); Harris Cnty. Comm’rs Court v. Moore, 420 U.S. 77, 84 (1975);
Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 U.S. 51, 54-55 (1973). Under these circumstances, Pullman directs the
federal district courts to avoid trying to forecast how the state courts would decide the unsettled
state-law question and to instead abstain to allow the state courts to resolve the question.
Pullman, 312 U.S. at 499-500. Such abstention avoids friction between federal and state courts,
reduces the likelihood that a federal court will make an erroneous interpretation of state law, and
may avoid unnecessary constitutional rulings. Id. at 499-501.
Pullman abstention is common in cases in which state-court resolution of the state-law
issue may moot or otherwise eliminate the need for the federal court to decide a federal

-3-

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 58 Filed: 03/14/14 Page 4 of 16

constitutional issue.

Complete elimination of the federal constitutional questions is not

necessary, however, and Pullman abstention is also proper if resolution of the pertinent state-law
issue will sharpen a federal constitutional issue or affect the scope or contours of the
federal litigation. See Am. Booksellers Ass’n, Inc. v. Hudnut, 771 F.2d 323, 327 (7th Cir. 1985);
E & E Hauling, Inc. v. Forest Pres. Dist. of DuPage Cnty., Ill., 821 F.2d 433, 436
(7th Cir. 1987); C-Y Dev. Co. v. City of Redlands, 703 F.2d 375, 380 (9th Cir. 1983).
Pullman abstention “does not . . . involve the abdication of federal jurisdiction, but only
the postponement of its exercise[.]”

Harrison v. Nat’l Ass’n for the Advancement of

Colored People, 360 U.S. 167, 175 (1959). The decision whether to abstain is a discretionary
exercise of the federal court’s equitable powers. Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 375 (1964);
Pullman, 312 U.S. at 500; Trust & Inv. Advisers, Inc. v. Hogsett, 43 F.3d 290, 293
(7th Cir. 1994). If abstention is granted, the district court typically stays its proceedings and
retains jurisdiction of the case pending a state court interpretation of the pertinent state law.
Pullman, 312 U.S. at 499-502. If the state court interpretation does not eliminate the basis of the
federal claims, the federal action can then resume. See Moses H. Cone Mem’l Hosp. v. Mercury
Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 10 n. 9 (1983).
In the present case, plaintiffs challenge the federal constitutionality of Article XIII, § 13,
of the Wisconsin Constitution (hereafter, “the Marriage Amendment”), which states:
Only a marriage between one man and one woman shall be valid or
recognized as a marriage in this state. A legal status identical or substantially
similar to that of marriage for unmarried individuals shall not be valid or
recognized in this state.

-4-

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 58 Filed: 03/14/14 Page 5 of 16

Plaintiffs claim that the restriction of the legal status of marriage under Wisconsin state law to
opposite-sex couples violates the due process and equal protection clauses of the
Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.2
Any evaluation of plaintiffs’ claims necessarily turns on the meaning of the
Marriage Amendment and, in particular, on: (1) the scope and severity of any legal disabilities it
may impose on same sex couples; (2) the particular meaning of the phrase “legal status . . . of
marriage;” and (3) the purpose and intent of the legislators who framed and legislatively passed
the Marriage Amendment and of the voters who ratified it. At the present time, the only
published state-court opinion addressing those issues is the decision of the Wisconsin Court of
Appeals in Appling v. Doyle, 2013 WI App 3, 345 Wis. 2d 762, 826 N.W.2d 666, which held that
the state constitutional definition of marriage as a relation between a man and a woman and the
prohibition on legislative recognition of a legal status for unmarried individuals identical or
substantially similar to that of marriage are not violated by those provisions of the
Wisconsin Statutes that confer some (but not all) of the legal benefits of marriage on same-sex
couples who register as domestic partners. In reaching that conclusion, the Court of Appeals
provided extensive discussion of each of the issues enumerated above. Id., ¶¶ 21-40, 41-64, and
76-91.
The Wisconsin Court of Appeals, however, is an intermediate appellate court and its
decision in Appling is currently under review by the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The case has
2

On the same constitutional grounds, plaintiffs also challenge “any and all provisions of
Wisconsin’s marriage statutes (Wis. Stat. ch. 765) that refer to marriage as a relationship between a
‘husband and wife,’ if and to the extent that such provisions constitute a statutory ban on marriage for
same-sex couples . . . .” (Dkt. #26, ¶ 1). Whether plaintiffs’ federal constitutional issues are phrased in
terms of the state constitution or in terms of state statutes, the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s interpretation
of the state-law issues in Appling will substantially affect this Court’s analysis of those federal issues.
Pullman abstention is, therefore, warranted in relation to all of the provisions of state law challenged by
plaintiffs. However, because plaintiffs have not specifically identified the challenged statutory
provisions, the argument of this memorandum will be stated in terms of the Marriage Amendment.

-5-

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 58 Filed: 03/14/14 Page 6 of 16

been fully briefed and orally argued to the Court and is awaiting decision. It is likely, therefore,
that by mid-July Wisconsin’s highest court will issue a decision that will provide an authoritative
interpretation of the meaning of the Marriage Amendment, with particular reference to the issues
enumerated above. Under these circumstances, the Pullman doctrine directs that this case should
be temporarily stayed, pending the outcome of Appling. Any subsequent briefing and review of
plaintiffs’ federal constitutional claims in this Court then will be able to benefit from the views
of the Wisconsin Supreme Court on these important state-law issues.
More specifically, in order to evaluate plaintiffs’ constitutional claims in this case, this
Court will be required to apply to the challenged provisions of Wisconsin law the analytical
framework that has been developed by the U.S. Supreme Court in the recent Windsor decision,
133 S. Ct. 2675. In that case, the Supreme Court held that the Due Process Clause of the
Fifth Amendment—including its equal protection component—was violated by the portion of the
federal Defense of Marriage Act (“DOMA”) that defined marriage, for all federal-law purposes,
as a legal union between one man and one woman.
The Supreme Court in Windsor began by acknowledging the historic power of the states,
rather than the federal government, to define and regulate marriage and found that it was in the
exercise of that historic power that some states, in recent years, have enacted state laws allowing
and recognizing same-sex marriages. Id. at 2689-92. With regard to this traditional allocation of
federal and state authority, the Court noted that “[t]he dynamics of state government in the
federal system are to allow the formation of consensus respecting the way the members of a
discrete community treat each other in their daily contact and constant interaction with each
other.” Id. at 2692. Against that background, the Court found that “DOMA’s unusual deviation
from the usual tradition of recognizing and accepting state definitions of marriage” suggested

-6-

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 58 Filed: 03/14/14 Page 7 of 16

that the federal law was motivated not by a permissible governmental purpose, but rather by an
improper purpose of injuring the same class of persons that some states had sought to benefit
through state marriage laws. Id. at 2693. The Court found evidence of such animus in the
legislative history of DOMA and in the inevitable effects of the statute’s practical operation,
including the broad scope of the burdens that the statute imposed on same-sex couples who have
been permitted to marry under the laws of a state. Id. at 2693-95. On the basis of these findings,
the Court concluded that the challenged section of DOMA had no legitimate governmental
purpose that could overcome its principal, impermissible purpose and effect of injuring a
particular class of persons. Id. at 2695-96.
Since Windsor, some federal district courts have applied and extended the reasoning of
that decision to invalidate state laws that restrict the legal status of marriage to opposite-sex
couples.

See Kitchen v. Herbert, ___ F. Supp. 2d ___, 2013 WL 6697874 (D. Utah

Dec. 20, 2013); Bishop v. United States ex rel. Holder, ___ F. Supp. 2d ___, 2014 WL 116013
(N.D. Okla. Jan. 14, 2014); Bourke v. Beshear, ___ F. Supp. 2d ___, 2014 WL 556729
(W.D. Ky. Feb 12, 2014); Bostic v. Rainey, ___ F. Supp. 2d ___, 2014 WL 561978 (E.D. Va.
Feb 13, 2014); De Leon v. Perry, ___ F. Supp. 2d ___, 2014 WL 715741 (W.D. Tex.
Feb. 26, 2014); see also Obergefell v. Wymyslo, ___ F. Supp. 2d ___, 2013 WL 7869139
(S.D. Ohio Dec. 23, 2013) (invalidating state constitutional and statutory bans on recognition of
same-sex marriages granted in other states). Plaintiffs in the present case ask this Court to apply
similar reasoning to invalidate Wisconsin’s restriction of the legal status of marriage to
opposite-sex couples.
In analyzing the constitutionality of a state law under the Windsor line of reasoning, a
court must consider the scope and severity of any disabilities that the challenged law imposes on

-7-

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 58 Filed: 03/14/14 Page 8 of 16

a particular group of people and the relationship of that scope to the purported goals of the law.
For purposes of the present case, there is currently no authoritative guidance on those issues from
Wisconsin’s highest state court. As noted above, however, the Wisconsin Supreme Court will
soon issue a decision in Appling which is expected to address the intent and purposes behind the
passage of the Marriage Amendment, the contours of the restrictions on the legal status of
marriage under Wisconsin state law, and the scope and severity of any claimed legal disabilities
that Wisconsin’s marriage laws may impose on same-sex couples. Under the Pullman doctrine,
therefore, it is appropriate for this Court to abstain from addressing the federal constitutional
issues raised by Plaintiffs in this case until the Wisconsin Supreme Court has decided Appling.
B.

Plaintiffs Would Not Be Significantly Harmed By A Temporary
Stay.

It is self-evident that any stay would create some delay in the present case. Under the
circumstances presented here, however, the burdens of any temporary delay would not be great
and are outweighed by the benefits of obtaining authoritative guidance on the important state-law
issues discussed above.
The Supreme Court has recognized that abstention may delay and increase the costs of
litigation, but has nonetheless found that, in appropriate cases, such concerns are outweighed by
the federalism interests that abstention promotes. See City of Chicago v. Fieldcrest Dairies,
316 U.S. 168, 172-73 (1942). The Court has nonetheless acknowledged that, in cases where
delay could lead to impairment of a plaintiff’s important civil rights, federal courts should
balance the nature of the alleged injury against the probable consequences of abstention.
Compare Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 404 (1974) (abstention inappropriate when
First Amendment challenge involved), with Harrison, 360 U.S. at 168-73 (abstention proper in

-8-

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 58 Filed: 03/14/14 Page 9 of 16

Fourteenth Amendment challenge to state laws allegedly designed to curtail activities of groups
such as NAACP).
In conducting such balancing of interests, the U.S. Supreme Court considers the
availability of a prompt state-court resolution of the pertinent state-law questions to be a factor
that a federal court should consider in deciding whether to abstain. Bellotti, 428 U.S. at 151
(discussing availability of certification of the state-law question to state court). Where there is
already pending a state-court action that is likely to resolve the pertinent state-law question
without the delay of having to commence a new proceeding in state court, that factor may tip the
scales in favor of granting abstention. See Harris Cnty. Comm’rs Court, 420 U.S. at 83; see also
Albertson v. Millard, 345 U.S. 242, 244-45 (1953); Fieldcrest Dairies, 316 U.S. at 173;
Ziegler v. Ziegler, 632 F.2d 535, 539 (5th Cir. 1980) (argument in favor of abstention more
compelling where there is already pending a state-court action that is likely to resolve the state
question). Even in a case involving civil rights, abstention is appropriate where the pertinent
state-law issue is already before the state’s highest court. Almodovar v. Reiner, 832 F.2d 1138,
1140 (9th Cir. 1987); Porter v. Jones, 319 F.3d 483, 493-94 (9th Cir. 2003).
When these principles are applied to the present case, the costs of any delay are low
enough to permit abstention. As previously noted, Appling is not only already pending before
the Wisconsin Supreme Court, but has already been fully briefed and orally argued, with a
decision reasonably expected no later than mid-July of this year. Even if this Court were to deny
the requested stay and proceed with this case on an expedited schedule, it is still highly unlikely
that Plaintiffs would be able to obtain the injunctive relief they seek prior to the decision in
Appling.

This Court has already noted, in its Order of March 4, 2014, that the

U.S. Supreme Court, in Herbert v. Kitchen, ___ U.S. ___, 134 S. Ct. 893 (2014), granted a stay

-9-

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 58 Filed: 03/14/14 Page 10 of 16

pending appeal of a district court order permanently enjoining the enforcement of a state-law
prohibition of same-sex marriages and that, since that action, every other federal district court
that has enjoined such a prohibition has similarly stayed the injunction pending appeal
(Dkt. #53 at 2-3). Under this line of cases, any permanent injunction that this Court might issue
following litigation of the merits of this case would also properly be stayed pending final
disposition of an appeal to the Seventh Circuit. Until such an appeal is completed, Plaintiffs
cannot obtain the injunctive relief they seek in this case and it is highly unlikely that the
proceedings in this Court and any subsequent appeal to the Seventh Circuit would be completed
before the Wisconsin Supreme Court issues its decision in Appling. A modest delay of the
proceedings in this Court for the purpose of obtaining the benefit of the Wisconsin
Supreme Court’s clarification of the meaning of the legal status of marriage under Wisconsin
state law and the scope of any burdens imposed by state law on same-sex couples thus should not
substantially delay any enforceable injunctive relief that Plaintiffs in this case might ultimately
obtain. Under these circumstances, the benefits of abstention outweigh the low costs of the
resulting delay.
C.

Considerations of Comity Also Support Abstention.

Considerations of federal-state comity also support abstention in this case. Under the
reasoning of Windsor, as previously discussed, plaintiffs’ constitutional claims require this Court
to determine the extent, if any, to which the challenged provisions of Wisconsin state law may be
motivated by baseless hostility to same-sex couples and hence devoid of any permissible
governmental purpose. In judicial proceedings involving the actions of government officials,
there is ordinarily a presumption of regularity.

For example, in determining whether a

challenged state action has a constitutionally permissible secular purpose under the
First Amendment’s Establishment Clause, the Supreme Court has characterized the review of the
- 10 -

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 58 Filed: 03/14/14 Page 11 of 16

government’s asserted purpose as a “sensitive task” and has indicated that a reviewing court
“must take the government at its word absent compelling evidence to the contrary.” McCreary
Cnty., Ky. v. Am. Civil Liberties Union of Ky., 545 U.S. 844, 903 n. 9 (2005).
Plaintiffs in this case are asking this Court to override the usual presumption of regularity
and to reach the serious and sensitive conclusion that an amendment of the fundamental charter
of a sovereign state by the state’s duly elected legislature and by the people of the state acting in
their sovereign capacity has been undertaken not in good faith and in accordance with the regular
principles of the rule of law, but rather with baseless animus against a particular group. There
can be some circumstances so extreme as to warrant the federal courts in reaching such a
conclusion. See, e.g., Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996) (holding that a state constitutional
provision that prohibited all legislative, executive, or judicial action at any level of state or local
government that would give minority or protected status based on homosexual orientation,
conduct, practices, or relationships was so inconsistent in scope with the reasons offered by the
state that it was inexplicable as anything other than an expression of animus toward
homosexuals). Such a severe judgment, however, is not one to be reached lightly. On the
contrary, considerations of comity and respect dictate that a federal court should not conclude
that such an act of state sovereignty has been undertaken in bad faith and with baseless animus
without first at least allowing the state’s highest court to clarify the meaning of the challenged
state law and the scope of any disabilities it may impose on the supposedly disfavored group.
For all of the above reasons, the Court should temporarily stay this case under the
Pullman abstention doctrine pending the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s decision in Appling.

II.

THE COURT SHOULD EITHER ABSTAIN UNDER THE BURFORD
ABSTENTION DOCTRINE OR ORDER OTHER STEPS TO PROTECT
THE COHERENT ADMINISTRATION OF WISCONSIN STATE
MARRIAGE LAWS.

In the alternative, if this case is not temporarily stayed for the purpose of allowing the
Wisconsin Supreme Court to clarify the meaning of the Marriage Amendment, the Court should
abstain pursuant to the doctrine of Burford or order other appropriate steps to protect the State of
Wisconsin’s important interest in the uniform and coherent administration of its marriage laws.
In Burford, the U.S. Supreme Court recognized that federal abstention may be
appropriate to defer to a state’s administration of a complex statutory scheme. The Court has
said that Burford abstention is proper when “federal review of the question in a case and in
similar cases would be disruptive of state efforts to establish a coherent policy with respect to a
matter of substantial public concern.” Colo. River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States,
424 U.S. 800, 814 (1976).

More generally, the Burford abstention doctrine provides that

“[c]ourts should abstain from deciding cases presenting ‘difficult questions of state law bearing
on policy problems of substantial public import whose importance transcends the result in the
case then at bar,’ or whose adjudication in a federal forum ‘would be disruptive of state efforts to
establish a coherent policy with respect to a matter of substantial public concern.’”
First Penn-Pac. Life Ins. Co. v. Evans, 304 F.3d 345, 348 (4th Cir. 2002) (emphasis added)
(quoting New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. Council of City of New Orleans, 491 U.S. 350, 361
(1989)). If either of those two prongs is met, a federal court should abstain under Burford.
McGee v. Cole, ___ F. Supp. 2d ___, 2014 WL 321122, *3 (S.D. W. Va., Jan. 29, 2014).
In the recent McGee case, involving a federal constitutional challenge to West Virginia’s
prohibition of same-sex marriage, the district court found that abstention under the first prong of
the Burford analysis was not proper because the issue of the status of same-sex marriage under

- 12 -

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 58 Filed: 03/14/14 Page 13 of 16

West Virginia law was not a difficult one, but rather had already been clearly determined.
Id., *5. With regard to the second prong of the Burford analysis, however, the court found that
federal-court adjudication of the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims could disrupt the uniform and
coherent implementation of state marriage policy because any judgment invalidating the state’s
ban on same-sex marriages would have been binding only on the two county clerks who were
named as defendants in that case. Id., *6-7. The court found that “this concern in creating a
coherent policy is sufficient ground for abstention,” but reserved judgment and gave the
plaintiffs an opportunity to either seek joinder of additional parties or file with the court an
explanation of why such joinder was not necessary. Id., *7.
The procedural posture in the present case is similar in all material respects to the posture
in McGee. Plaintiffs in this case have named three individual county clerks—i.e., the clerks of
Milwaukee, Racine, and Dane counties—as defendants in this action.3 The clerks of all the other
counties in Wisconsin, however, are not before the Court in this case. Accordingly, as in
McGee, any injunctive relief that this Court might issue would be binding on the three defendant
county clerks, but would not be binding on any other county clerks in the state. Because the
county clerks in Wisconsin issue all marriage licenses, see Wis. Stat. § 765.12(1), a judgment in
plaintiffs’ favor in this case could create a situation in which the three defendant county clerks
would be required to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, while other county clerks
would not be subject to that requirement and could continue to issue marriage licenses only to
opposite-sex couples. As the McGee court noted, the resulting confusion and lack of coherence
and uniformity in the administration of state marriage policy “is sufficient ground for
abstention[.]” McGee, 2014 WL 321122, *7.
3

All Plaintiffs who allege that they are currently unmarried and wish to marry in Wisconsin reside
in those three counties (Dkt. #26, ¶¶ 14-18).

- 13 -

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 58 Filed: 03/14/14 Page 14 of 16

The presence of the State Defendants in this case does not allay these concerns about
coherence

and

uniformity.

With

regard

to

Governor

Scott

Walker,

plaintiffs’

Amended Complaint alleges only that he has a general duty under the Wisconsin Constitution to
take care that the laws of the state are faithfully executed (Dkt. #26, ¶ 20). With regard to
Secretary of Revenue Richard G. Chandler, plaintiffs allege only that he has the authority to
enforce the revenue code of Wisconsin (Dkt. #26, ¶ 22). With regard to State Registrar of
Vital Statistics Oskar Andersen, plaintiffs allege only that he has the authority to establish the
form of a marriage license and to accept for registration and assign a date of registration to
marriage documents (Dkt. #26, ¶ 23). Finally, with regard to Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen
and District Attorneys John Chisholm and Gary King, plaintiffs allege only that they each have
the authority to initiate a prosecution under Wisconsin’s marriage evasion statute (Dkt. #26,
¶¶ 21, 24, and 25). None of these allegations is sufficient to support a conclusion that any of the
State Defendants has any legal power to direct the actions of Wisconsin’s county clerks with
regard to the issuance of marriage licenses, nor are the State Defendants independently aware of
any such power.4

There simply is nothing that this Court could order any of the current

defendants in this case to do or not do that would be sufficient to ensure a uniform and coherent
statewide policy regarding the issuance of marriage licenses.
Faced with a similar situation, the McGee court concluded that sufficient grounds for
Burford abstention existed but chose, under the circumstances of that case, to reserve its
decision on abstention and to afford the plaintiffs an opportunity to either seek joinder of
additional parties or explain to the court why such joinder was not necessary.

McGee,

2014 WL 321122, *7. Because the posture of the present case is materially analogous to the
4

County clerks in Wisconsin are independently elected county officers, directly accountable to the
electorate. See Wis. Stat. § 59.20(2)(a).

- 14 -

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 58 Filed: 03/14/14 Page 15 of 16

situation in McGee, this Court similarly should either order abstention under Burford or reserve
judgment on Burford abstention and direct such other steps as the Court may deem appropriate to
protect the state interest in the coherence of state marriage policy. If a Pullman stay is granted,
the Burford issue still should be addressed prior to any resumption of this proceeding.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, the State Defendants respectfully ask the Court
to temporarily stay the present case under the Pullman abstention doctrine until the Wisconsin
Supreme Court has issued a decision in the pending case of Appling v. Walker. In the alternative,
State Defendants ask the Court to abstain under the Burford abstention doctrine or to order other
appropriate steps to protect the uniform and coherent administration of Wisconsin state marriage
laws. If a Pullman stay is granted, State Defendants ask that the Burford issue also be addressed
prior to any subsequent resumption of this proceeding.
Dated this 14th day of March, 2014.
