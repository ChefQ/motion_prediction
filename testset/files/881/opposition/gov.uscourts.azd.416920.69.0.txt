Since the agreement was signed in 2004, Best Western has consistently been on

I NT R ODUC T I ON

notice that the hotel that is the subject of this action was principally a venture by Hooshang
Harooni but operated through business entities. 1 Mr. Harooni has at all times been the
responsible party, and the party that has been damaged by the actions of Best Western. The

Mr. Harooni disputes that Best Western is properly regarded as a "non-profit membership" rather than a
franchise. However, for purposes of this motion only, it will be referred to as such. Further, Mr. Harooni

wrongful termination of the agreement forced Mr. Harooni to dissolve the business entities

2

that he had set up to handle the complex operations of the hotel. The losses of those

3

business entities, both as a matter of law and as a matter of fact, were suffered personally

4

by Mr. Harooni. To the degree that the business entities would otherwise have been the

5

real parties in interest, Mr. Harooni, as the principal for each entity, is now the

6

representative of those interests. Alternatively, Rule 19 permits amending to allow the

7

real parties in interest to proceed. As such, Best Western's central argument fails.

Before and after the agreement was signed, Best Western promised services and
support. The representations are specific and confirmed by uncontroverted evidence.

10

Moreover, because these clear representations were inducement to enter into the contract

11

with Best Western, and were affirmed after the contract was signed, the integration clause

12

does not relieve Best Western for its breach of the agreement. Mr. Harooni reasonably

13

relied upon those representations and Best Western's failure to provide them after

14

affirmation constitutes breach of contract. There is no contention that the promised services

15

were for Mr. Harooni, alone. Best Western has not, and cannot, contend that the fees at

16

issue in this case were solely for the use of the Best Western standard. See SSCF, § II, ¶ 70.

17

Best Western wrongfully terminated the agreement, frustrated the purpose of the contract,

18

and engaged in litigation tactics to prevent Mr. Harooni from pursuing legitimate claims.

19

The factual support for these and the following arguments are set forth in the concurrently

20

It is black letter law that the party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of

showing that there is no material issue of fact for trial. See, e.g., “Credibility
determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from
the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S.
believes that California law should govern as subject matter is most closely related to California.

242, 255 (1986). “The evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable

2

inferences are to be drawn in his favor.” Id.

3

Here, Best Western argues that Mr. Harooni cannot show damages. That is

4

inaccurate; Best Western has all underlying documents, has acknowledged through

5

discovery and deposition that money invested into the hotel that came from Mr. Harooni's

6

personal accounts. Moreover, as will be demonstrated, losses of the corporation pass

7

through to Mr. Harooni. Mr. Harooni can, and has, substantiated that he personally suffered

8

damages. The amount is a question of fact. Even if breach of contract damages are

9

limited by the agreement - which is disputed here - bad faith damages are not. Best Western

10

wrongfully terminated the agreement, failed to provide services promised and reaffirmed,

11

and failed to honor the conditional extension provision in its own contract. Best Western

12

cannot prevail on summary judgment.

B.

M r . H ar ooni's Damages ar e A dequately Shown as a M atter of L aw

14

Mr. Harooni personally suffered losses as a result of the corporation's losses, both

15

through direct investment, loans and pass-through losses. Losses suffered by a closely held

16

subchapter S Corporation such as AV Operations Group, Inc. are passed through to Mr.

17

Harooni as the shareholder. See 26 USCS § 1366; SSCF, § I, ¶ 19. They are personal

18

damages.

19

AV Operations Group, Inc. was a subchapter S corporation ("S Corp") organized

20

under the laws of the State of California. Id. Shareholders in an S corporation are taxed on

21

their share of the S corporation's income regardless of whether the corporation makes any

22

distributions. Heller v. Franchise Tax Bd., 21 Cal. App. 4th 1730, 1734 (Cal. Ct. App. 1994)

23

(citing 2 Plant & Eager, CAL. TAXATION (2d ed. 1993) § 45.40, at p. IV-1704.2.); see also

24

BITTKER & EUSTICE, FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION OF CORPORATIONS AND SHAREHOLDERS

25

(5th ed. 1987) P 6.08, p. 6-25.)). As with income, losses from an S Corp are also passed

26

through to the individual shareholder. 26 USCS § 1366; Durando v. United States, 70 F.3d

27

548, 550 (9th Cir. 1995). For all relevant purposes, "S Corps" are essentially like

28

partnerships: income is passed through to the shareholders, who report their pro rata shares

on their individual income tax returns. Durando, supra. (citing I.R.C. §§ 1363(a), 1366(a),

2

1371(a)(1)). There is, and can be, no dispute that the losses of a partnership would be

3

considered the partners' losses. 26 USCS § 465. As reflected on the tax returns and

4

documents produced in this case, Mr. Harooni's losses are properly measured by the losses

5

of the corporation.

6

The Schlesinger Conrad Law Firm

Filed 04/28/10 Page 4 of 19

Best Western argues that "Harooni cannot demonstrate that he incurred any damages.

7

Instead, Harooni appears to claim he is entitled to recover damages allegedly incurred by

8

two separate independent corporate entities, neither of which has a counterclaim pending

9

against Best Western in this case." See Motion for Summary Judgment, Dkt. 57, 7:1-5. As

10

stated above, for accounting purposes and as to losses, the corporation is not a "separate

11

independent corporate entity." See Durando, supra; 26 USCS § 465. Election as an S

12

corporation enables the corporation to be treated essentially as a non-taxable pass-through

13

entity allowing each shareholder to report as part of his or her gross income the

14

shareholder's pro rata share of the corporation's income, losses, deductions, and credits,

15

regardless whether the corporate net income is actually distributed to the shareholders. See

16

26 U.S.C. § 1366 (1995); accord A.R.S. § 43-1126(A) and (B).

17

The case of U.S. v. Bishop, 291 F.3d 1100, 1105 (9th Cir. 2002), is instructive as to

18

the handling of profit and loss in a closely held corporation. In that case the court noted that

19

"profits and losses passed through to the shareholders without first being taxed to the

20

corporation. It was undisputed at trial that: (1) some S-corporations commonly designate

21

interim payments to their shareholders as “officer loans” until the end of an accounting

22

period because the classification of profit and loss is uncertain, (2) an S corporation

23

shareholder who is at personal risk may apply the corporate loss against compensation on

24

his or her personal tax return, and (3) an at-risk shareholder may carry losses forward or

25

back to other tax years as may be appropriate under existing regulations." Id.; see also 26

26

U.S.C.A. §§ 1371 et seq., 1372(e), (e)(1, 3). The case of Durando, supra, 70 F.3d at 550, is

27

in accord. In that case, the Court stated that "[a]n S corporation is a small business

28

1

corporation . . . Although treated like ordinary 'C' corporations in many respects, S

2

corporations are taxed like partnerships." Id. (citing I.R.C. §§ 1363(a), 1366(a), 1371(a)(1)).

3

Here, AV Operations Group, Inc. was an S corporation. See SSCF ,§ I, ¶ 19.

4

Therefore, the profits and losses passed through to the only shareholder: Hooshang Harooni.

5

Accordingly, Mr. Harooni has standing to assert the corporate losses as his personal losses.

6

Moreover, should Best Western succeed on this argument, it would obtain a windfall. The

7

losses are Mr. Harooni's, the corporation is dissolved, and the harm inflicted by Best

8

Western fell on its voting member, Mr. Hooshang Harooni.

9

The Schlesinger Conrad Law Firm

Filed 04/28/10 Page 5 of 19

In asserting that there is no evidence regarding damages incurred by Mr. Harooni,

10

Best Western chooses to overlook the testimony of its own expert, John Gorman. Mr.

11

Gorman testified that there is no clear delineation between the entities, AV Inn Associates I,

12

LLC, AV Operations Group, Inc., and Harry Harooni. SSCF, § I, ¶ 17. Importantly, Mr.

13

Gorman stated clearly that the $2,000,000 in renovations performed by Mr. Harooni was not

14

attributed to either business entity in the accountings. Id. The reason is simple: Mr.

15

Harooni financed those amounts himself. See Declaration of Harry Harooni, supra; See

16

also Declaration of Scott Evans, attached hereto as Exhibit 3. This is consistent with Mr.

17

Gorman's testimony that there was at least $1.1 million not accounted for by the various tax

18

returns for AV Inn Associates 1, LLC and AV Operations Group, Inc. SSCF, § I, ¶¶ 5, 18.

19

Of particular note, Best Western's expert, John Gorman, made no effort to determine where

20

the $2 million was spent, or to which entity it was properly credited. See SSCF, § I, ¶ 5,

21

supra. Further, Best Western has admitted that it was aware that Mr. Harooni put

22

approximately $ 2 million into the hotel. Indeed, Terry Wininger stated that she knew that

23

some of that money was spent before Best Western embarked on its five-year mission to

24

elevate the standards for Best Western hotels. SSCF, § I, ¶ 12. This comports with Mr.

25

Harooni's testimony that he invested cash into the hotel. SSCF, § I, ¶ 5. Under these

26

circumstances, there may be a question as to the amount of damages that Mr. Harooni

27

personally incurred, but there is no question that he can show personal losses sufficient to

Mr. Harooni has a Right to Bring the Counterclaim Individually

It is well-established that where the individual has suffered an individual loss, no

5

derivative suit is required. See Denevi v. LGCC, LLC, 121 Cal. App. 4th 1211, 1221 (2004)

6

(one who has suffered injury both as an owner of a corporate entity and in an individual

7

capacity is entitled to pursue remedies in both capacities); see also Albers v. Edelson Tech.

8

Partners, L.P., 201 Ariz. 47, 52 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2001) (citations omitted).

9

Denevi, the court considered whether the plaintiff had a right to bring a direct suit on claims

In the case of

10

of fraud against defendants. The shareholder plaintiff brought an individual action having

11

already brought a separate derivative action. Id. at 1216. Defendants moved for summary

12

judgment alleging, inter alia, that the individual suit represented an attempt at double

13

recovery. The trial court agreed that the plaintiff could not sue in his personal capacity. Id.

14

On appeal the court found that the loss to the corporation was neither necessary nor

15

sufficient to show the losses to plaintiff individually. Id. at 1219. "In the absence of a

16

cogent demonstration to the contrary, we must presume that each claimant was entitled to

17

pursue his or its own remedies, even if the underlying rights to relief arose from a single act

18

or course of conduct on the part of defendants." Id. Citing to Jones v. H. F. Ahmanson &

19

Co., 1 Cal. 3d 93, 107 (Cal. 1969), the court found that the individual wrong necessary to

20

support a suit by a shareholder need not be unique to that plaintiff. The same injury may

21

affect a substantial number of shareholders. "If the injury is not incidental to an injury to the

22

corporation, an individual cause of action exists." Id. at 1221. The Denevi defendants'

23

argument that the plaintiff's ownership interest in a limited liability company somehow

24

magically erased the harm that plaintiff suffered personally was untenable. Such ownership

25

"cannot categorically bar [plaintiff's] personal claim for damages for that harm." Id. at

26

1223. Accordingly, the individual claims were permitted to go forward.

27
28

Of note, the court in Denevi also noted that a primary reason for a derivative suit is to
prevent successive litigation with potentially contradictory results. Id. In that case,
4814-0976-4358, v. 1

6
OPPOSITION TO BEST WESTERN'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

Case 2:08-cv-02274-DGC Document 69

1

defendants had resisted the ability of plaintiff to join the individual and derivative cases.

2

Therefore, the appellate court found that "any harm flowing from their successive

3

prosecution is attributable directly to defendants, who successfully resisted plaintiff's

4

repeated efforts to present all claims in a single proceeding. Defendants cannot now be

5

heard to insist that plaintiff be barred from the courthouse to shield them from the natural

6

consequences of their own litigation strategy." Id. at 1222. Indeed, the orders necessitating

7

separate actions were only made at defendants' instance. Therefore, Defendants were

8

estopped from arguing that a separate action could not go forward. Id.

9

The Schlesinger Conrad Law Firm

Filed 04/28/10 Page 7 of 19

A similar situation exists in this case. First, Mr. Harooni is not barred from pursuing

10

an action for his individual losses. Those losses are readily calculated from the

11

documentation produced during discovery. SSCF, e.g., ¶ 5, supra, including the

12

Declaration of Scott Evans; Declaration of Azia-Lavi. Moreover, the counterclaim by the

13

limited liability company was specifically cut off when Defendant's argued that no such

14

claim should be permitted. Best Western's "Motion for Clarification" makes it clear that

15

there was some confusion as to the parties that had a viable counterclaim. (Dkt. 37). In

16

truth, Best Western had already answered the counterclaim by AV Inn Associates, LLC.

17

(Dkt. 24). Therefore, Best Western's legal tactics should not be permitted to now bar Mr.

18

Harooni his personal claims.

19

There is, and can be, no real dispute that Mr. Harooni had a personal relationship

20

with Best Western. Best Western is suing Mr. Harooni for more than $75,000. He was the

21

voting member at the hotel, as well as the controlling shareholder and managing member.

22

Best Western's citation to Schroeder v. Hudgins, 142 Ariz. 395, 690 P.2d 114 (App. 1984)

23

is, therefore, easily distinguished. In fact, that case specifically states that "[t]o obtain a

24

personal right of action, there must be relations between the individual and the tortfeasor

25

independent of those which the shareholder derives through his interest in the corporate

26

assets and business." Schroeder 142 Ariz. at 398. Best Western chooses to ignore the fact

27

that the plaintiff in Schroder, unlike Mr. Harooni in this case, did not have that personal

28

relationship with defendant. The plaintiff in that case was a guarantor of a loan, but had no

relationship with the third party defendant. Id. (appellant was an attempted assignee of a

2

legal malpractice claim and guarantor of a third party loan). Clearly, that case in inapposite

3

to the facts at issue here.

4

Equally unavailing is Best Western's citation to Hidalgo v. McCauley, 50 Ariz. 178,

5

182-183, 70 P.2d 443, 445 (1937). That case specifically sets forth the premise that where

6

the defendant set out to damage the corporation, the individual shareholder has no personal

7

cause of action when the right that is invaded is "trespass upon or conversion of the

8

corporation's property." Id. at 183. First, Best Western dealt with Mr. Harooni, personally.

9

Second, the line of cases following from Hidalgo make it clear that every claim of damage

10
11
12
13
14
15
16

to a corporation is not necessarily reserved solely to the corporation:
Generally, a stockholder may not maintain an action in his own behalf
for a wrong done by a third person to the corporation on the theory that
such wrong devalued his stock and the stock of the other shareholders,
for such an action would authorize multitudinous litigation and
ignore the corporate entity. . . . But 'if the injury is one to the plaintiff as
a stockholder and to him individually, and not to the corporation, as
where the action is based on a contract to which he is a party, or on
a right belonging severally to him, or on a fraud affecting him directly,
it is an individual action. . . . And a stockholder may sue as an
individual where he is directly and individually injured although the
corporation may also have a cause of action for the same wrong.
Funk v. Spalding, 74 Ariz. 219, 223 (Ariz. 1952) (emphasis added).

17
18

Here, Mr. Harooni was a party to the contract, and the damage felt by Best Western's

19

actions falls squarely on Mr. Harooni in the same manner it would have been felt by the S

20

corporation. See 1 Willis et al., PARTNERSHIP TAXATION (4th ed. 1993) § 2.03, p. 2-8 ["[t]he

21

most noteworthy aspect of S corporations is the pass-through characteristic they share with

22

partnerships, under which the character of income, deduction, loss, and credit passes

23

through unchanged to the shareholders of S corporations"); see also SSCF, § I, ¶ 19.

24

Further, Best Western is suing Mr. Harooni for joint and several liability on the contract,

25

which clearly evidences that Mr. Harooni is personally damaged by the conduct of Best

26

Western. He has lost almost everything, including the business entities, his credit and

27

millions of dollars that he personally spent on the hotel. That loss is reflected in the tax

28

returns and by affidavit. See SSCF, § I, ¶ 5. Therefore, Best Western's argument that there

is no personal right to Mr. Harooni's counterclaim fails as a matter of law. At a minimum,

2

the extent of losses suffered by Mr. Harooni is a question of fact inappropriate for

3

determination on summary judgment.
2. No Attempted Transfer Terminated the Agreement

4
5

The Schlesinger Conrad Law Firm

Filed 04/28/10 Page 9 of 19

Best Western argues that the agreement was terminated due to Mr. Harooni's use of

6

business entities to operate the hotel. In the first instance, this novel theory has not been

7

asserted or disclosed previously. More importantly, however, if Best Western failed to

8

provide consent for such a transfer, the transfer would be void as a matter of law. See, e.g.,

9

Cibran Enters. v. BP Prods. N. Am., Inc., 365 F. Supp. 2d 1241, 1251 (S.D. Fla. 2005).

10

The case of Cibran is very similar to the facts here. In that case, Mr. Cibran entered

11

into a transaction with BP for petroleum. BP continued to raise its prices on gas until Mr.

12

Cibran was unable to compete in the local market. When he incurred several charges due to

13

insufficient funds, BP sought to cancel the agreement. On summary judgment, BP argued,

14

inter alia, that Mr. Cibran had no standing to claim because of an attempted transfer of the

15

business interests from Mr. Cibran individually to his closely held corporation, Cibran, Inc.

16

The contract prohibited any transfer without approval by BP. After noting that contract

17

rights can generally be assigned, the court rejected BP's claim that Mr. Cibran could not

18

enforce the agreement. The attempted transfer was ineffective due to BP's lack of consent

19

to that transfer. Id. (citing New Holland, Inc. v. Trunk, 579 So. 2d 215, 217 (Fla. 5th DCA

20

1991)).

21

After finding that the transfer was ineffective, the court permitted a substitution of

22

parties in the case that had been filed solely in the name of the corporation. In so doing, the

23

court recognized that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide:

24
25
26
27
28

No action shall be dismissed on the ground that it is not prosecuted in
the name of the real party in interest until a reasonable time has been
allowed after objection for ratification of commencement of the action
by, or joinder or substitution of, the real party in interest; and such
ratification, joinder, or substitution shall have the same effect as if the
action had been commenced in the name of the real party in interest. Id.
at 1251 (citing FRCP 17(a)).
The court went on to find that where "[t]he complaint's only pertinent flaw was the

identity of the party pursuing those claims, substitution of parties is appropriate." Id. at

2

1252 (citing Advanced Magnetics, Inc. v. Bayfront Partners, Inc., 106 F.3d 11, 20 (2d Cir.

3

1997) (internal quotes omitted)). Specifically, the court stated that "Mr. Cibran should be

4

allowed to join the suit as a party-plaintiff because the pertinent flaw in Cibran's Verified

5

Second Amended Complaint (as it pertains to this issue) is merely the identity of the party

6

pursuing the claims." Id.

7

Cibran demonstrates at least two distinct points that are applicable to this case: (1)

8

Best Western cannot argue that Mr. Harooni breached the agreement due to any purported

9

transfer of interests to his corporations because without Best Western's approval, such

10

transfers would be ineffective; and (2) to the degree that any transfer to AV Operations

11

Group, Inc. is deemed effective, any viable corporation would be properly substituted in as

12

the real party in interest. Further, even if substitution is not deemed appropriate, assignment

13

makes Mr. Harooni the real party in interest. 2 See, e.g., CA Corp. Code § 2100, et seq.

14

Accordingly, assignment of the causes of action to Mr. Harooni obviates any need for a

15

claim in the name of the business entities.
3. Mr. Harooni is Entitled to Represent the Dissolved Corporations

16
17

Best Western overlooks the fact that Mr. Harooni is the proper party to bring the

18

claims that would have been AV Inn's were that limited liability corporation still viable. The

19

Secretary of State records reflect a cancellation has been filed, and the company has not

20

been viable since October 2009. "There is no doubt that upon termination of the corporate

21

existence by dissolution and while the statutory trustees are in charge for the purpose of

22

winding up the corporate business, a shareholder in the defunct corporation may commence

23

and maintain suit upon a claim of that corporation." Castner v. First Nat'l Bank, 278 F.2d

The corporation/third-party beneficiary is dissolved. Mr. Harooni is the successor and/or representative of
the corporation. A corporate shell is not an indispensable, or even a proper, party to an action. See, e.g.,
Avlon v. 829-31 Restaurant Corp., 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14043 (D.N.Y. 1993). Moreover, under Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 19, if this Court believes that the corporation is the real party in interest, then the
Court has the power to determine that AV Operations Group, Inc. is a proper counterclaimant and amend the
pleadings.

10
11

Section 2001 of the California Corporations Code sets forth the powers and duties of

12

directors and officers in relation to dissolved corporations. Specifically, that section states

13

that the director or officer is empowered to "carry out contracts and collect, pay,

14

compromise and settle debts and claims for or against the corporation." He is further

15

authorized to "defend suits brought against the corporation." Id. at 2001(d). A chose in

17

Here, because the companies were dissolved following Best Western's bad faith

18

termination of the membership agreement, Mr. Harooni is the appropriate representative for

19

the companies. As acknowledged by Best Western, Mr. Harooni stands as the only

20

shareholder for the corporation and the managing member of the limited liability company.

21

Therefore, the claims asserted by Mr. Harooni appropriately include the sums due to the

22

corporation and limited liability company.
4. The LLC and Harooni are Considered a Single Entity

23
24

Best Western makes much of the allegedly separate nature of AV Inn and Mr.

25

Harooni. However, the analysis is flawed and, because Mr. Harooni is the principal

26

member of the LLC, they are actually considered a single entity. Mr. Harooni was

27

managing member of the LLC. See SSCF, § I, ¶ 21.

1

Current tax regulations allow a limited liability company that is properly formed

2

under state law to be taxed as a partnership without regard its corporate characteristics.

3

This tax treatment allows an LLC to operate as informally and flexibly as a partnership, and

4

still possess all the structural advantages of a corporation in terms of limited liability,

5

centralized management, continuity of life, and free transferability of interests. See

6

Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., 1-2 TAX PLANNING FOR PARTNERS, PARTNERSHIPS, AND

7

LLCS § 2.02. "If the sole member is an individual, the venture is taxed as a sole

8

proprietorship (i.e., the entity is disregarded)." Id. Here, Mr. Harooni is the sole member of

9

the LLC. Therefore, the venture is disregarded. For all practical purposes, Mr. Harooni is

10
11

AV Inn.
This is outcome also supported by the general notions of conversions of a business

12

entity into another form. For example, in C & J Builders & Remodelers, LLC v.

13

Geisenheimer, 249 Conn. 415, 421 (Conn. 1999), the court found that "upon conversion of a

14

general or limited partnership to a limited liability company, 'all property owned by the

15

converting general or limited partnership remains vested in the converted entity . . . [and] . .

16

. all obligations of the converting general or limited partnership continue as obligations of

17

the converted entity . . . .'" Id. Thus, all of the converting partnership's property and

18

obligations are transferred to the newly converted entity by operation of law. The new

19

entity is, in effect, the "successor in interest" to the converted business. Id.; see also

20

Rosenfeld, Meyer & Susman v. Cohen, 146 Cal. App. 3d 200, 217, 194 Cal. Rptr. 180

21

(1983).

22

A similar analysis applies to the dissolved corporation of AV Operations. As

23

discussed above, where a corporation is dissolved, the sole shareholder is the identity that is

24

responsible for winding up the business. Indeed, every item of loss claimed by AV

25

Operations would be considered part of a joint, consolidated return by AV Operations and

26

Mr. Harooni because the operation of the property at issue in this litigation was by and

27

between Mr. Harooni and the two companies. Inasmuch as Mr. Harooni is the sole member

28

of the affiliated group, the profits and losses, including the claims against Best Western,

would be part of a consolidated return. See American Pacific Whaling Co. v.

2

Commissioner, 74 F.2d 613, 616 (9th Cir. 1935). Therefore, in this case, there is no proper

3

entity to pursue the claims against Best Western except Mr. Harooni, the sole shareholder of

4

the corporation. To the degree that the business entities suffered losses, under the

5

circumstances of this case losses are recoverable by Mr. Harooni, and no other.

1. Best Western Materially Breached the Contract

7

The Schlesinger Conrad Law Firm

Filed 04/28/10 Page 13 of 19

Mr. Harooni is not obligated to Best Western under its contract because Best Western

9

materially and wrongfully breached the terms of the contract. First, the contract does not

10

allow for termination without cause. SSCF, § II, ¶ 15. That provision is consistent with

11

California Franchise Relations Act ("CFRA"), which states that a franchisee may not

12

terminate a franchise except for good cause. See Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code ("B&P") § 20020

13

("[N]o franchisor may terminate a franchise prior to the expiration of its term, except for

14

good cause."). That Best Western is, in fact, a franchise rather than a "non-profit

15

membership," cannot seriously be debated. See SSOF, Exhibit 17 (Total assets of Best

16

Western in 2007 equaled $89,774,162); see also B&P § 20001, et seq. Whether good cause

17

exists to terminate a contract is a matter of fact not appropriate for summary judgment.

18

A trier of fact reviewing all evidence in this case will find that there was no good

19

cause to terminate the agreement. Regardless of which law is followed, the contract at issue

20

required "impartial, standardized and nondiscriminatory inspection procedures." SSCF, ¶

21

16. It further required the "fair application" of the rules and bylaws. Id. The contract also

22

required that Best Western provide a conditional membership in lieu of termination. Id.: see

23

also Bylaws, Art. II, § 7(A)(7); see Defendant's/Counterclaimant's Motion for Summary

24

Judgment, incorporated by reference.

25

In this case, there was no good cause for termination. Wrongful termination, coupled

26

with the failure to provide specific services promised to Mr. Harooni and referenced in the

27

agreement are most assuredly material because the hotel owner was deprived of the essence

28

of the contract - his right to be a Best Western hotel. Indeed, Best Western's breach led

directly to the forfeiture of the right vested in Mr. Harooni. The law abhors forfeitures.

See, e.g., Nasir v. Sacramento County Off. of the Dist. Atty., 11 Cal. App. 4th 976, 986 (Cal.

3

Ct. App. 1992).

The Schlesinger Conrad Law Firm

This stands in stark contrast to the case cited by Best Western, Best Western Int.'l v.

5

Sharda, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52502 (D. Ariz. June 22, 2009). First, in Sharda, this Court

6

was forced to rule solely on Best Western's Motion for Summary Judgment as counsel for

7

Sharda did not file a sufficient response to the Motion for Summary Judgment. Id. at *16.

8

Best Western, therefore, was never put to the test of whether they had "good cause" to

9

terminate the membership of defendants in that case, and forfeiture of membership after

10

failure to defend was not unreasonable. Second, the finding that the Best Western rules

11

allow for point losses is only the most general of premises; it says nothing about the

12

egregiously subjective inspections that go into the point loss in this case. Def.'s SSOF, e.g.,

13

¶ 56. Mr. Harooni has demonstrated that the problem in this case is not his "strong

14

disagreement" with the inspections, but rather the change in Best Western's standards after

15

he had invested millions of dollars. Best Western did not even inform Mr. Harooni of the

16

changed standards, but rather hid behind its point system. SSCF, ¶ 53, supra.

17

Unlike the defendants in Sharda, the subjective nature of the inspections clearly

18

makes the difference in this case. The point total in Sharda was allegedly 273. Id. at 14.

19

Even had the inspector not been subjective, as was clear in this case, the hotel at issue there

20

undoubtedly had significant problems. Here, the point score averaged 796 - just a few

21

points away from what Best Western considers a "passing score." See Def.'s SSOF, ¶ 55.

22

Further, Mr. Harooni had his designs approved by Best Western, purchased furniture

23

through Best Western and/or at their direction, and he spent millions renovating the hotel.

24

There was no question it was better than it had been before his purchase. Moreover, Mr.

25

Harooni told Best Western that he was running out of money, and the failure to ever resolve

26

the problem with the reservation system could have made the difference. Def's SSOF, ¶ 36.

27

Best Western's discussion that certain aspects of the hotel that could have been better

28

misses the point. No one is arguing the hotel was perfect. That does not change the fact

that it was Best Western's conduct (including the new five-year plan to upgrade hotels to a

2

point not contemplated by the parties at the inception of the contract) that led to the

3

wrongful termination. That plan was not in place when Mr. Harooni purchased the hotel,

4

and it was never explained to him. SSCF, § I, ¶ 12; see also Def.'s SSOF, ¶ 56. Although

5

Mr. Harooni was willing to do everything demanded by the action plan that Best Western

6

created, it simply was not enough. SSCF, § I, ¶ 15. Finally, Best Western failed to abide by

7

the contract and grant the conditional membership in lieu of termination as required.

These issues were not under consideration in the Sharda case, and therefore, that
case should have no bearing here. Indeed, defendants in that case made no answer

10

whatsoever, much less ever raised the grave concern of a Board of Directors that make

11

admittedly arbitrary termination decisions. In this case, Best Western materially breached

12

the contract and, in so doing, frustrated any purpose of the agreement. Mr. Harooni had no

13

further obligation to pay membership fees when his membership had been wrongly

14

terminated.

15

2. The Integration Clause Does Not Preclude Additional Evidence

16

The Court has a duty to "attempt to enforce [the] contract according to the parties'

17

intent." Intent is determined by interpreting the contract. Ervco, Inc. v. Texaco Ref. &

18

Mktg., 422 F. Supp. 2d 1084, 1087 (D. Ariz. 2006) (citing Taylor v. State Farm Mut. Auto.

19

Ins. Co., 175 Ariz. 148, 854 P.2d 1134, 1138 (Ariz. 1993). Arizona adheres to the "Corbin

20

approach," which allows the court to look at extrinsic evidence to determine the intent of the

21

parties without a preliminary finding of ambiguity. Id. Best Western's argument that the

22

integration clause shields it from its misrepresentations to Mr. Harooni also fails because (1)

23

the representations were inducement to enter the agreement; (2) the representations were

24

repeated after the contract was signed; (3) the representations are not contrary to the written

25

contract (and in fact are in accord with it); and (4) Mr. Harooni clearly pleaded fraud in the

26

inducement. 3 The cases cited by Best Western demonstrate the error in Best Western's

27
3

28

Mr. Harooni filed the counterclaim in pro per, and as this Court well knows, prior counsel failed to file an
amendment during the time permitted by the court to do so. The Court should look to the of the complaint

reasoning. For example, in Pinnacle Peak Developers v. TRW Inv. Corp., 129 Ariz. 385

2

(App. 1980), the court stated that "the application of the parol evidence rule moved along a

3

continuum based on the extent of the contradiction, the relative strength and sophistication

4

of the parties, and their negotiations." Id.

5

The Schlesinger Conrad Law Firm

Filed 04/28/10 Page 16 of 19

In this case the intent of the parties regarding services and assistance to Mr. Harooni

6

is well-established. Not only does Terry Wininger admit that she made representations to

7

Mr. Harooni regarding the availability of services prior to his signing the contract, she

8

acknowledges that these representations would be made to all prospective owners. The

9

contract itself states that services including reservation systems, marketing services and the

10

like are available to members. See Membership Agreement re reservations systems; Bylaws,

11

Members Bill of Rights, No. 12 (member has the right to receive Best Western Services). It

12

is equally clear based upon the deposition testimony and the history of the parties'

13

relationship that services were not tendered. In fact, the "services" were a ruse to charge

14

members additional fees, e.g., design fees and additional advertising fees. Thus, the

15

integration clause is, at best, ambiguous. Parol evidence most assuredly is available to

16

prove the extent and scope of the services promised both by Wininger and within the

17

"Governing Documents." The counterclaim makes it clear that the promise of services was

18

inducement to enter the contract such that consideration lies. Moreover, Best Western

19

makes much of its alleged status as a "non-profit membership" and asserts that its main

20

function is to provide services for all of its members. Under these circumstances, it cannot

21

be heard to claim that there was no consideration for the very services membership entails.

22

This is particularly true because Best Western invoices for numerous alleged services,

23

including advertising, design and regional service managers. See Complaint, Ex. 2. In any

24

event, the extent of promised services, as referenced in the documents, is a question of fact

25

for a jury as the evidence clearly shows some services were promised and not provided.

27
28

and not penalize Mr. Harooni for an lack of specific title. The Counterclaim states:"Plaintiff induced me to
purchase the franchise through falsehood and failed to perform all the promised services." Counterclaim, ¶

3. The Reasonable Expectations Doctrine and Equitable Estoppel Apply

2

In Arizona, it is well established that where the bargaining power of two contracting

3

parties is significantly unequal, the more sophisticated of the two drafts a contract that is a

4

contract of adhesion and extremely one-sided, and the representatives of the drafting party

5

make representations that are calculated to induce reliance, the doctrines of reasonable

6

expectations and equitable estoppel prevent enforcement of boilerplate terms. See Darner

7

Motor Sales v. Universal Underwriters Ins. Co., 140 Ariz. 383 (Ariz. 1984).

8

Here, all of the requirements set forth in Darner are present. The contract was

9

drafted by Best Western, and it is extremely one-sided. For example, it purports to limit the

10

hotel owner's recovery to the membership fees, while providing that Best Western "shall

11

have the right to invoke any remedy at law or in equity" and asserts that its remedies are

12

cumulative." See Membership Agreement, ¶ 30. Terms such as the alleged obligation to

13

continue paying assessments for the calendar year are buried deep in the Bylaws (Art. II, §

14

5), were not highlighted and are oppressive. Such terms contradict the basic notion that a

15

member is paying for advertising and other services while he is the owner of the hotel and,

16

ostensibly, a part of the membership cooperative claimed to be Best Western's structure.

17

Likewise, Best Western had every reason to know that if the services were not promised and

18

if Mr. Harooni had understood that he would be arbitrarily terminated based upon subjective

19

inspections, he would not have entered into the deal. He stated plainly, and Ms. Wininger

20

recorded, the fact that this was Mr. Harooni's first venture into hotels, and that his two

21

proposed partners backed out. He clearly stated his concerns and relied upon Best

22

Western's promised assistance. See SSOF, Ex. 15 (KANA Log); see also Declaration of

23

Hooshang Harooni, SSOF, Ex. 2. Reliance on services promised by Best Western was far

24

more than "the fervent hope usually engendered by loss." Darner Motor Sales, 140 Ariz. at

25

390. Rather, it was the reasonable expectation induced by Best Western, its personnel and

26

its documents. The documents cannot now permit Best Western to trample its member's

27

rights.

11

Lavi also testified to his many years of experience in accounting and his work with clients

12

litigation. SSCF, § I, ¶ 33. Best Western makes no argument that they have been

20

procedural rules are "be interpreted to maximize the likelihood of a decision on the merits".
