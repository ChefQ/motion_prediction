separate grounds: (1) Harooni’s counterclaim fails because there is no evidence of and

2

he cannot prove he suffered damages; (2) Harooni’s alleged oral agreements/promises

fail for indefiniteness, lack of consideration, and the Membership Agreement’s

integration clause; (3) termination of Defendants’ Best Western membership did not

constitute a breach of the Membership Agreement, Best Western’s Bylaws and Articles

(“Bylaws”) or Rules and Regulations (“Rules and Regulations”), (the Membership

Agreement, Bylaws, and Rules and Regulations collectively, the “Governing

Documents”), or any duty/obligation implied therein; (4) any alleged malfunction of the

reservation system did not constitute a breach of the Governing Documents, or any

proposal deadlines for customers did not constitute a breach of the Governing

BACKGROUND

14

Best Western operates as a membership association of independently owned and

15

operated hotels (i.e., its members). (Plaintiff’s Statement of Facts (“PSOF”) ¶ 1.) The

16

relationship, duties, and obligations of Best Western and its members, including

17

Defendants, are created and governed by the Governing Documents. (Id. ¶ 9.) The

18

Governing Documents require members to adhere to quality standards with respect to

19

cleanliness of guestrooms and bathrooms and permit the Best Western Board of

20

Directors (the “Board”) to terminate a membership for failure to meet cleanliness

21

quality standards. (Id. ¶ 10.) The quality standards insure that each Best Western

22

member is offering quality products and services to customers and further perpetuating

23

the goodwill attributable to and benefiting all Best Western members. (Id. ¶ 11.)

24

The Board terminated Defendants’ membership with respect to the property

25

formerly known as the Best Western Antelope Valley Inn, located in Lancaster,

26

California and referenced in Best Western’s records as property T-05050 (the “Hotel”),

27

based upon Defendants’ failure to maintain the level of quality required by the

28

Governing Documents. (Id. ¶¶ 5, 14-18.) Defendants received two Guest Room and

Public Area (“GRPA”) inspection scores of less than 800 points on two consecutive

2

inspections on October 25, 2007 and January 31, 2008, thereby subjecting their

3

membership to termination as provided for by the Governing Documents. (Id. ¶¶ 12-

4

15.)

5

hearing was held wherein the Board considered termination of Defendants’

6

membership. (Id. ¶ 16.) Harooni attended that hearing and was given an opportunity to

7

address the Board.

8

Defendants’ Best Western membership.

9

Defendants failed to pay outstanding amounts owed to Best Western. (Id. ¶ 19.) Best

10

Western sued Defendants for breach of contract, breach of open account, and breach of

11

stated account to collect the unpaid amounts. (Id. ¶ 20.)

After Defendants received the second GRPA score of less than 800 points, a

At the hearing, the Board decided to terminate
(Id. ¶ 18.)

Subsequent to termination,

12

When Defendants filed their Answer, Defendants were not represented by

13

counsel. (Id. ¶ 21.) Before Defendants retained counsel, Defendants sought leave to

14

assert a counterclaim against Best Western styled “BREACH OF CONTRACT,

15

BREACH OF IMPLIED CONTRACT, BREACH OF IMPLIED COVENANT OF

16

GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING.” (Id. ¶ 22.) The Court only permitted the

17

counterclaim to be asserted by Harooni, however, because AV Inn Associates, a

18

corporate entity, was not represented by counsel. (Id. ¶ 23.)

19

Months after Defendants retained counsel, Best Western sought clarification of

20

which parties had pending counterclaims against Best Western. (Id. ¶ 24.) The Court

21

ruled that AV Inn Associates had no counterclaim and that Harooni was the only party

22

with a counterclaim pending against Best Western. (Id. ¶ 25 (quoting Dkt. # 45 that

23

“[t]he pending counterclaim in this case, therefore, has been asserted only on behalf of

24

Defendant Harooni, not on behalf of Defendant AV Inn [Associates]”).)2

2

material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R.

3

Civ. P. 56(c). In this case, the undisputed facts demonstrate that Best Western is

entitled to judgment as a matter of law, in whole or in part, on (1) its claims against

5

7

A.

Summary judgment is proper in favor of Best Western on its
claims against Defendants

8

Best Western sued Defendants for breaches of contract, open account, and stated

9

account. (PSOF ¶ 20.) The elements of proof for Best Western’s breach of contract

10

claim are (1) existence of a contract, (2) breach of that contract, and (3) damages. See

11

Graham v. Asbury, 112 Ariz. 184, 185, 540 P.2d 656, 656 (1975) (“To bring an action

12

for the breach of the contract, the plaintiff has the burden of proving the existence of the

13

contract, its breach and the resulting damages.”)

14

Western’s open account claim are “to prove the correctness of the account and each

15

item thereof.” Holt v. W. Farm Servs., 110 Ariz. 276, 278, 517 P.2d 1272, 1274 (1974).

16

Open accounts are accounts “where there are running or concurrent dealings between

17

the parties, which are kept unclosed with the expectation of further transactions.”

18

Krumtum v. Burton, 111 Ariz. 448, 450, 532 P.2d 510, 513 (1975) (quoting Connor

19

Livestock Co. v. Fisher, 32 Ariz. 80, 85, 255 P. 996, 997 (1927)). The elements of proof

20

for Best Western’s stated account claim is an agreement by the parties regarding the

21

balance due from Defendants to Best Western. See, e.g., Holt, 110 Ariz. at 277-278,

22

517 P.2d at 1273-72 (“An account stated is an agreed balance between the parties to a

23

settlement; that is, that they have agreed after an investigation of their accounts that a

24

certain balance is due from one to the other.”)

The elements of proof for Best

25

The uncontestable evidence demonstrates that (1) a written contract exists

26

between Defendants and Best Western, (PSOF ¶ 2 & Ex. 2 thereto), (2) Defendants

27

agreed to pay Best Western “fees, dues, charges, and assessments imposed generally on

28

the membership,” (id. ¶ 91), (3) Defendants agreed to pay the “cost of goods or services

provided by or ordered through Best Western,” (id.), and (4) Defendants have not paid

2

Best Western for all fees, dues, charges, and assessments imposed on the membership or

3

for all goods and services received by Defendants, (id. ¶¶ 19, 93.)

4

As of December 1, 2008, Defendants owed Best Western $75,219.59

5

representing certain fees and other charges imposed on Defendants pursuant to the

6

Governing Documents. (Id. ¶ 93.) All of the charges, fees, dues, and assessments

7

reflected upon the Statements filed with Best Western’s Complaint (Dkt. #1-2) are

8

charges, fees, dues, and assessments permitted to be charged to Defendants pursuant to

9

the Governing Documents. (Id. ¶¶ 94-95.) Interest accrues on past due amounts at the

10

rate of 1.5% per month. (Id. ¶ 91.) Accordingly, each element of Best Western’s

11

breach of contract, open account, and account stated has been demonstrated herein by

12

uncontested and/or uncontestable evidence.

13

Western against Defendants in the amount of $75,219.59 plus interest at the rate of

14

1.5% per month from December 1, 2008, until paid by Defendants, is proper.

Summary judgment in favor of Best

15

Defendants may claim that they cannot be held liable to Best Western for

16

charges, fees, dues, and/or assessments imposed after Defendants’ membership was

17

terminated. The Bylaws provide, however, that “[a]ny member may resign from [Best

18

Western] at any time but if the Member resigns or is terminated, fees and dues for the

19

remainder of the fiscal year will become immediately due and payable.” (Id. ¶ 93

20

(emphasis added).) Accordingly, such a claim would be without merit.

21

Defendants may also claim that they cannot be held liable to Best Western for

22

charges, fees, dues, and/or assessments imposed if Defendants’ Best Western

23

membership was wrongfully terminated. As demonstrated infra at 18-20, however,

24

termination of Defendants’ Best Western membership conformed with the Governing

25

Documents and covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Accordingly, such a claim

26

would be without merit.

27

Defendants may also claim that they cannot be held liable to Best Western for

28

charges, fees, dues, and/or assessments imposed because Best Western did not

satisfactorily provide services to Defendants. Despite interrogatories to Defendants

2

regarding their basis to contest the amounts owed to Best Western, Defendants could

3

not identify a specific service related to the outstanding balance that was not

4

satisfactorily provided. (See id. ¶ 97.) Such a claim would be, therefore, without merit.

5

Defendants may also claim that they cannot be held liable to Best Western for

6

charges, fees, dues, and/or assessments imposed because Best Western failed to

7

maintain its reservation system and/or inform Defendants of RFP deadlines. While Best

8

Western contests such allegations as demonstrated infra at 20-22, the alleged issues

9

occurred in 2005 and 2006, and have no relationship to the charges, fees, dues, and/or

10

assessments reflected in the Statements filed with Best Western’s Complaint for 2008.

11

(See id. ¶ 96.) Accordingly, such a claim would be without merit. Best Western is

12

entitled to summary judgment on its claims against Defendants.

13

B.

14

Harooni’s counterclaim sounds in contract, and requires Harooni to prove that a

15

contract existed, was breached, and that he suffered damages. See Graham, 112 Ariz. at

16

185, 540 P.2d at 656; United Dairymen of Ariz. v. Schugg, 212 Ariz. 133, 139 ¶ 21, 128

17

P.3d 756, 762 (App. 2006) (holding that a claim for breach of the covenant of good faith

18

and fair dealing fails absent proof of damages).

Summary Judgment on Harooni’s counterclaim is proper

19

Harooni’s counterclaim fails because (1) Harooni has no admissible evidence to

20

prove the damages element of his counterclaim; (2) Harooni’s alleged oral

21

agreements/promises fail for indefiniteness, lack of consideration, and the Membership

22

Agreement’s integration clause; (3) termination of Defendants’ Best Western

23

membership did not constitute a breach of the Governing Documents, or any

24

duty/obligation implied therein; (4) any alleged malfunction of the reservation system

25

did not constitute a breach of the Governing Documents, or any duty/obligation implied

26

therein; and (5) any alleged failure to inform Harooni of requests for proposal deadlines

27

for customers did not constitute a breach of the Governing Documents, or any

28

duty/obligation implied therein.

Harooni cannot prove his damages

Harooni cannot demonstrate that he incurred any damages.

Instead, Harooni

appears to claim he is entitled to recover damages allegedly incurred by two separate

independent corporate entities, neither of which has a counterclaim pending against Best

Western in this case.

6

Membership Agreement, but has no counterclaim pending against Best Western. (See

7

PSOF ¶¶ 3-4, 25.) AV Inn Operations Group, Inc. (“AV Inn Operations”) is neither a

8

party to this litigation nor a party to the Membership Agreement, has no counterclaim

9

pending against Best Western, and therefore has no existing cause of action to recover

10

from Best Western. (Id. ¶ 4, 6.) Harooni testified that AV Inn Associates owned the

11

real property and leaseholds at the Hotel, and that AV Inn Operations owned and

12

operated the businesses located on that property, i.e. the Hotel, restaurant, bar and

13

banquet hall. (Id. ¶¶ 26-27.) Harooni is a 50% interest holder in AV Inn Associates,

14

and Harooni’s spouse, Jila Harooni, who is not a party to this litigation, holds the other

15

50% interest in AV Inn Associates.3 (Id. ¶ 28.) Harooni has not pled his counterclaim

16

as a derivative claim on behalf of either entity. (See id. ¶ 49.) AV Inn Associates

20

since AV Inn Operations is not a party to the Membership Agreement (id. ¶¶ 3, 6), and

21

has no other cause of action against Best Western, AV Inn Operations could not have

22

asserted a claim against Best Western. Because Harooni can offer no evidence of his

damages, summary judgment on Harooni’s counterclaim is proper.

3

(1937) (observing that “[e]ven when all the stock is owned by a sole shareholder, there

4

seems no adequate reason to depart from the general rule that the corporation and its

5

shareholders are to be treated as distinct legal persons”); Sutter v. Gen. Petroleum

7

may not maintain an action in his own behalf for a wrong done by a third person to the

8

corporation on the theory that such wrong devalued his stock and the stock of the other

9

shareholders, for such an action would authorize multitudinous litigation and ignore the

10

corporate entity.”). This is logical, fair and reasonable in that an individual should not

11

be permitted to use a corporate entity as a shield from personal liability, but also use it

12

as a personal sword to recover for him or herself. As a matter of law, Harooni cannot

13

recover from Best Western for losses allegedly suffered by AV Inn Associates or AV

14

Inn Operations. Moreover, AV Inn Operations has no plausible cause of action against

15

Best Western as Best Western owed no duty and/or obligation to AV Inn Operations.

16

Harooni also testified that he has no evidence of alleged damages that he

17

personally incurred. The only evidence Harooni can offer with respect to damages is

18

the testimony of an expert witness whose disclosed expert report evaluated alleged

19

damages of only AV Inn Operations, which is not a party to this litigation and is not a

20

party to the Membership Agreement. Such expert disclosures were also defective.

21

Harooni cannot prove any damages he allegedly incurred, even as such damages would

22

be as limited by the limited by the Membership Agreement. Summary Judgment in

23

favor of Best Western is therefore proper.

24

Written discovery propounded upon Defendants revealed that Harooni could not

25

produce any evidence of damages. In response to an interrogatory asking “how much

26

Defendants seek to recover from Best Western in the Litigation,” Harooni responded

27

that “Defendants aver that Defendants purchased the Hotel for $8.9 million and sold it

28

for $4.8 million. Mr. Harooni spent close to $2 million in renovations, and defendants

are attempting to determine how much money they lost due to the malfunctioning

2

reservation system and after the membership was terminated.” (PSOF ¶ 36.) When

3

asked by interrogatory how damages were calculated, Harooni responded “[b]y

4

assessing expenditures.”

5

amounts sought to be recovered, Harooni responded that “Defendants claim damages

6

due to the malfunctioning reservation system and losses sustained as a result of the

7

Hotel’s loss of affiliation with Best Western.” (Id. ¶ 38.) When asked to identify

8

evidence supporting their claimed damages, Defendants responded as follows:

9

“Defendants are in the process of acquiring and will produce the Escrow Statements for

10

the purchase and sale of the Hotel. Defendants are in the process of obtaining the

11

additional financial records from their accountant and will update this answer at that

12

time.” (Id. ¶ 39.) At Best Western’s request, Defendants supplemented their responses

13

on October 28, 2009, but Defendants still could not quantify the amount of damages

14

sought or adequately describe the measure of their damages. (Id. ¶ 35.)

(Id. ¶ 37.)

When asked for an itemized list of specific

Plaintiff's counsel expressed concern that Defendants have not

problems in Defendants' disclosures due in part to unforeseen
health problems, but stated that Defendants will produce a
complete expert report by the Court's deadline of November 6,
2009, that will set forth Defendants' damages claims. In light
of that coming disclosure, the Court concluded that ordering
additional discovery responses is not warranted. The expert
reports produced by the parties shall be full and complete expert
reports in compliance with Rule 26. The Court stated that if
Defendants do not produce an expert report by November 6,
2009, Defendants will not be permitted to present a damages
expert.

On November 6, 2009, Defendants disclosed a report prepared by Elias Aziz

2

Lavi (“Lavi”), a Certified Public Accountant (the “Lavi Report”). (Id. ¶ 41.) The Lavi

3

Report revealed that alleged damages sought by Harooni were incurred by AV Inn

4

Operations, an entity that is not a party to this case, and is not a party to the

5

Membership Agreement.4 (Id. ¶¶ 6, 42.) The Lavi Report stated as follows:

Western learned for the first time that a transfer from AV Inn Associates to AV Inn Operations
occurred only upon the deposition of Harooni which took place on December 4, 2009. (Id. ¶¶
26-27.) The procedures outlined in Article II, § 7(B) were not followed in this case (id. ¶ 30)

obligations under Governing Documents to AV Inn Operations.

disclosure of the Lavi Report, Harooni testified that the only evidence he could offer

2

with respect to damages was the testimony of Lavi. (Id. ¶ 47.) Yet Harooni, who was

3

then represented by counsel, made no attempt to seek to amend the pleadings to include

4

AV Inn Operations as a party. (Id. ¶ 48.) Moreover, Harooni has made no attempt to

5

amend his pleadings to allege that he is personally seeking to recover damages incurred

6

by AV Inn Associates or AV Inn Operations. (Id. ¶ 49.)

7

Harooni, the only party with a counterclaim pending, cannot offer any evidence

8

of damages he allegedly incurred as the Lavi Report only assessed alleged damages of

9

AV Inn Operations. Harooni’s counterclaim fails because it is undisputed that Harooni

10

can offer no evidence of damages. See Lemon v. Harlem Globetrotters Int'l, Inc., 437

11

F. Supp. 2d 1089, 1104 (D. Ariz. 2006) (observing that if “evidence does not create a

12

triable issue with respect to the damages suffered,” summary judgment is proper).

13

Moreover, Lavi should be precluded from testifying because he can offer no

14

testimony relevant to Harooni’s claims. As demonstrated supra, Lavi only reported on

15

the losses allegedly incurred by AV Inn Operations, not losses allegedly incurred by

Harooni disclosed the Lavi Report, but not Lavi’s qualifications or a list of other cases

5

in which Lavi has testified at trial or by deposition during the last four years. (PSOF ¶

any specificity of what Lavi actually considered. (Id. ¶ 51.)

When Best Western deposed Lavi on December 11, 2009, Lavi testified that he

10

had not provided counsel for Defendants a curriculum vitae or a list of recent litigation.

11

(Id. ¶ 52.) Lavi testified, however, that he was most recently deposed as an expert

12

witness 2-3 years earlier. (Id. ¶ 53.) Moreover, when Lavi produced the documents he

13

considered in response to Best Western’s subpoena, the documents included more than

14

2200 pages of tax returns and other documents and records disclosed to Best Western

15

for the first time on December 4, 2009, almost one month after disclosure of Lavi as an

16

expert witness. (Id. ¶ 54.) Despite the Court’s express order that the Harooni produced

17

expert report “shall be full and complete expert reports in compliance with Rule 26,”

18

Harooni did not comply with the disclosure requirements, and Lavi should be precluded

19

from testifying. See, e.g., Elgas v. Colo. Belle Corp., 179 F.R.D. 296, 300 (D. Nev.

Hotel because of his lack of qualification. Despite the fact AV Inn Associates owned

2

the real property under the Hotel, Lavi reported as to AV Inn Operations as follows:

3

The company sold the property in July, 2009, to avoid incurring
additional loss on the operations of the hotel. The property was
not sold on the basis of its best use which is a hotel property as a
result of the withdrawal of Best Western name but was sold to a
medical college. Lost income on the sale of the property
amounted to $1,300,000.00.

Defendants’ Best Western membership was cancelled, however, on or about
April 8, 2008 (id. ¶ 57), before the offer to purchase the Hotel on June 15, 2008, which
Harooni testified he rejected because it was too low. (Id. ¶ 58.) The Hotel was not
sold until July of 2009. (Id. ¶ 59.) Defendants have offered no evidence of any
reduction in value of the Hotel as a result of the termination at the time of the
termination. During his deposition, Lavi testified that he had no specific qualification to
testify as an expert regarding the value of real property. (Id. ¶ 60.) Accordingly,
testimony from Lavi should be precluded to the extent that it is offered as to the value of
the Hotel at the time of the termination with and without the Best Western membership.
See United States v. Chang, 207 F.3d 1169, 1172 (9th Cir. 2000) (“To qualify as an
expert, a witness must have ‘knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education’
relevant to such evidence or fact in issue.”) As demonstrated supra, without Lavi’s
testimony, Harooni has absolutely no evidence of damages to offer and cannot, as a
matter of law, recover from Best Western.

Finally, the Membership Agreement contains a limitation of damages provision:

6

Applicant agrees that Applicant shall be limited to actual
damages for any breach or default by Best Western of any
obligation or duty owed to Applicant, and Applicant further
agrees that Best Western’s liability for any damages shall be
limited to the amount of the membership fees actual paid by
Applicant in connection with the Hotel, during a single fiscal
year in which the breach or default occurred.

7

(Id. ¶ 61.) Despite the foregoing provision, Harooni has disclosed no evidence that he

Harooni’s alleged oral agreements/promises fail for

Agreement’s integration clause

Harooni claims that Terry Wininger, Best Western District Manager, “induced
Mr. Harooni to purchase the hotel after 2 other buyers backed out,” and “promised to
provide support because of his inexperience in the hotel business.” (Id. ¶ 62.) Harooni
claims that “[s]ome of the services that Plaintiffs promised Defendants were pursuant to
oral agreement.” (Id. ¶ 63.) In supplemental responses to Best Western’s discovery,
Harooni stated as follows:

22

Ms. Wininger stated Best Western had various support that
would be available to Mr. Harooni to aid him in running the
hotel, including money management, account management,
design help. These representations were made orally during the
initial interview and there are no documents containing these
promises.

The oral agreement was between Terry Wininger and Hooshang

Mr. Harooni in running the hotel if he was to purchase the hotel.
Those promises included money management, account
management, design help, and general help with day to day
operations of the hotel.

Assuming for purposes of this motion only that the alleged oral

agreements/promises were made before Harooni executed the Membership Agreement,5

the parol evidence rule applies. The Membership Agreement unambiguously states that

5

“[i]f the application is approved in writing by Best Western, the Membership

6

Agreement and License Agreement sections will control the relationship between

7

Applicant and Best Western.” (Id. ¶ 66.) The Membership Agreement further states as

follows:

9

This Membership Application and Agreement embodies the
whole agreement of the parties. There are no promises, terms,
conditions or obligations other than those contained herein.
This Membership Application and Agreement shall supersede
all previous communications, representations, or agreements,

(Id. ¶ 67.) “The parol evidence rule, as traditionally stated, renders inadmissible any
evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral understandings and of prior written
understandings, which would contradict, vary or add to a written contract which was
intended as the final and complete statement or integration of the parties’ agreement.”
Pinnacle Peak Developers v. TRW Inv. Corp., 129 Ariz. 385, 389, 631 P.2d 540, 544
(App. 1980). While an integration clause cannot shield a contracting party from claims
of fraud and misrepresentation, see Wagner v. Rao, 180 Ariz. 486, 885 P.2d 174 (App.
1994), Harooni has not asserted such claims against Best Western. Instead, Harooni
claims that Best Western breached oral agreements/promises, and has only set forth
claims for breach of contract, breach of implied contract, and breach of the covenant of
good faith and fair dealing in his complaint. The parol evidence rule and the integration
clause of the Membership Agreement bar Harooni from making such claims. Summary
judgment in favor of Best Western is therefore appropriate.

Harooni testified that the alleged oral agreements/promises were made before Harooni

design and stuff. That wasn't part of her sales pitch. And she
said we have money manager who monitor your accounts at all

are there to help you. And like Mitch type of a person that

everything is going to be okay, we have money manager, we
have people that come in to monitor your revenue for you, we
have a field officer, anytime you want, he'll be there to help you
with any questions that you have." And the other chain -- and at

services “[v]ery vaguely” stating that Wininger was simply explaining the services Best

Western offered members, “[it] was not specific for us,” but rather “service they

provided to all the members.”

monitoring was not specific for the Hotel, but was a service offered to all Best Western

to be provided above and beyond that guaranteed by the Governing Documents,

termination of a Best Western membership based upon poor inspection scores:
Best Western's rules and regulations provide that members will
be subjected to twice-annual inspections of their properties.
These inspections begin with a total of 1,000 points; deductions
are then made for specific deficiencies found at the properties.
The minimum acceptable inspection score is 800. Properties
receiving a score below 800 are placed on probation. Best
Western's Board of Directors may cancel the membership
agreement with respect to any property that receives two
consecutive scores below 800 or a single inspection score below
600. Before cancelling a membership agreement, the rules and
regulations require that Best Western grant a hearing before its

observed several inspections performed by Van Wormer testified that Van Wormer
would not overlook problems, and that he would mark down deficiencies he saw and
deduct points for such deficiencies. (Id. ¶ 78.)
Moreover, the existence of the conditions leading to the failing scores are
undisputed. Eseltine, who was present for each of the two failing inspections, as well as
previous inspections, verified the existence of numerous physical conditions giving rise
to each of the failing scores. (Id. ¶ 79.) Harooni also verified the existence of numerous
physical conditions leading to point deductions as well. (Id. ¶¶ 80-81.) Accordingly,
the existence of the conditions leading to the point deductions is not contested.

Accordingly, Best Western is entitled to summary judgment that

Any alleged malfunction of the reservation system did not
constitute a breach of the Governing Documents, or any
duty/obligation implied therein

Harooni alleges that in late 2005 and early 2006, Best Western’s reservation
system malfunctioned thereby entitling Harooni to relief pursuant to a claim of relief
sounding in contract. Best Western contests such allegations and, should this issue go
to trial, will offer evidence demonstrating that the alleged issues with the reservation
system were a direct result of operator error by employees or agents of the Hotel. As a
legal matter for summary judgment, Best Western had no legal obligation to provide an
error free system all of the time, and Defendants cannot dispute that the issue was
quickly resolved satisfying any obligation Best Western had under the Governing
Documents to address the alleged issue.
The Governing Documents include provisions relating to Best Western’s
reservation system. (Id. ¶ 83.) The Governing Documents do not guarantee that Best
Western’s reservation system, including the software and hardware used at the hotel
level, will be free of errors and malfunctions at all times. (Id. ¶ 84.) While Best
Western would like to be able to make such a guarantee, such a guarantee is
unreasonable and unrealistic. The Membership Agreement even recognizes that errors
and malfunctions are bound to occur when it states that the member shall “participate in

PHOENIX \ 676230.1 \ 015091.009

20

Case 2:08-cv-02274-DGC Document 57

the troubleshooting process” should a failure or interruption occur, and that “[i]t shall be

2

the sole responsibility of Best Western to make final problem determination and

3

dispatch technical resources as needed to achieve problem resolution,” thereby

4

eliminating any unrealistic expectation that Best Western’s reservation system shall be

5

error proof all of the time. (Id. ¶ 85.) As a matter of law, therefore, Best Western

6

cannot be held liable in contract for a, obligation and/or duty that is not included in the

7

Governing Documents and/or constitutes a unrealistic, unreasonable expectation

8

expressly disclaimed in the Governing Documents.

9

Moreover, Best Western’s obligations under the Governing Documents were

10

satisfied when the issue was quickly resolved. The Hotel’s Director of Sales testified

11

that the issue was resolved by Best Western’s Regional Service Manager within a week

12

of Defendants notifying Best Western of the issue. (Id. ¶ 86.) The General Manager

13

testified that the issue was actually resolved within a day or less.

14

Accordingly, to the extent Best Western had an obligation to resolve the issue, that

15

obligation was satisfied promptly upon notifying Best Western.

(Id. ¶ 88.)

16

To the extent the issue constituted a breach of contract, which it did not, the

17

breach was not material. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 241 provides that the

18

Court should consider the following factors in determining whether a breach is material:

19
20
21
22
23
24

(a) the extent to which the injured party will be
deprived of the benefit which he reasonably expected;
(b) the extent to which the injured party can be
adequately compensated for the part of that benefit of which
he will be deprived;
(c) the extent to which the party failing to perform or
to offer to perform will suffer forfeiture;

25

27

(d) the likelihood that the party failing to perform or
to offer to perform will cure his failure, taking account of all
the circumstances including any reasonable assurances;

28

(e) the extent to which the behavior of the party

corporate accounts through a request for proposal (“RFP”) process, and that Best

17

Western allegedly failed to do so in 2005. Harooni did not retain professional sales staff

18

until early 2006 believing that he could do it himself. (Id. ¶ 89.) The Governing

19

Documents contain no provision obligating Best Western is to inform its members of

20

deadlines to submit RFP’s to potential customers. (Id. ¶ 90.) Harooni’s expectations to

21

the contrary are not supported by the Governing Documents. Best Western cannot be

22

held liable for Harooni’s own lack of success in participant in the RFP process.

23

III.

CONCLUSION

24

Based upon the foregoing, Best Western requests summary judgment, in whole

25

or in part, on (1) Best Western’s claim against Defendants and/or (2) Harooni’s

26

counterclaim.
