Leave to File Counterclaim) 23 (Harooni’s Counterclaim).)

4

23.

The Court only permitted the counterclaim to be asserted by Harooni,

5

however, because AV Inn Associates, a corporate entity, was not represented by

6

counsel. (Dkt. # 25.)

Months after Defendants retained counsel, Best Western sought

8

clarification of which parties had pending counterclaims against Best Western. (Dkt. #

25.

Harooni was the only party with a counterclaim pending against Best Western:

12

Plaintiff has filed a motion asking the Court to clarify that no
counterclaim has been filed by Defendant AV Inn Associates 1,
LLC ("AV Inn"). Defendants have not responded, and the time
for responding has passed. The Court's Case Management Order
(Dkt. #18) set a 60-day deadline for amending pleadings and
adding parties. Defendants moved before this date for leave to
file a counterclaim. The Court granted the motion with respect
to Defendant Harooni, but denied it with respect to Defendant
AV Inn because AV Inn was not represented by counsel in this
matter. Dkt. #25. Counsel later appeared on behalf of
Defendants (Dkt. #28), but no further effort was made to assert
a counterclaim on behalf of AV Inn. The pending counterclaim
in this case, therefore, has been asserted only on behalf of
Defendant Harooni, not on behalf of Defendant AV Inn. Signed

You yourself did not have any interest in the

A.
The LLC owned the property. And a corporation
owned the businesses inside the hotel.
Q.

What was the name of that corporation?

A.
AV Inn Associates -- no. AV Inn something
corporation. I don't remember.
Q.

Okay. So I guess -- let me back up.

When I use the term "AV Inn" in this deposition, I'm
going to change that and use the term AV Inn, LLC. It seems
here that you are telling me there is another entity that may be
AV Inn Corp. I am not familiar with that entity. So I may be
misnaming it. But I'm going to call it AV Inn Corp. if that is
okay with you.

Q.
Is it your understanding that AV Inn, LLC had title to

What do you mean by most of the property?

Q.
So the banquet hall was part of the operations

land. That was the -- that was the only function.

Best Western propounded written discovery upon Defendants on July 9,

Defendants’ responses to Best Western’s discovery were due on August

9, 2009. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 32(b)(2).
33.

Best Western agreed to an extension of time through September 17, 2009

due to personal matters of Defendants’ counsel, and the Court entered an order

not serve their discovery responses until September 29, 2009, twelve days late. (See Ex.

J (excerpts of Defendants’ Answers to Plaintiff’s Interrogatories).

October 28, 2009, but Defendants still could not quantify the amount of damages sought

8

or adequately describe the measure of their damages.

10

36.

(See Ex. K (excerpts of

In response to an interrogatory asking “how much Defendants seek to

11

recover from Best Western in the Litigation,” Harooni responded that “Defendants aver

12

that Defendants purchased the Hotel for $8.9 million and sold it for $4.8 million. Mr.

13

Harooni spent close to $2 million in renovations, and defendants are attempting to

14

determine how much money they lost due to the malfunctioning reservation system and

15

after the membership was terminated.” (Exs. I ¶ 27 & J ¶ 27.)

16
17
18

37.

When asked by interrogatory how damages were calculated, Harooni

responded “[b]y assessing expenditures.” (Exs. I ¶ 28 & J ¶ 28.)
38.

When asked for an itemized list of specific amounts sought to be

19

recovered, Harooni responded that “Defendants claim damages due to the

20

malfunctioning reservation system and losses sustained as a result of the Hotel’s loss of

21

affiliation with Best Western.” (Exs. I ¶ 29 & J ¶ 29.)

22

39.

When asked to identify evidence supporting their claimed damages,

23

Defendants responded as follows: “Defendants are in the process of acquiring and will

24

produce the Escrow Statements for the purchase and sale of the Hotel. Defendants are

25

in the process of obtaining the additional financial records from their accountant and

26

will update this answer at that time.” (Exs. I ¶ 30 & J ¶ 30.)

27

entered an order stating as follows:

Plaintiff's counsel expressed concern that Defendants have not
fully disclosed the damages they will be seeking in their
counterclaim. Defense counsel agreed that there have been some
problems in Defendants' disclosures due in part to unforeseen
health problems, but stated that Defendants will produce a
complete expert report by the Court's deadline of November 6,
2009, that will set forth Defendants' damages claims. In light of
that coming disclosure, the Court concluded that ordering
additional discovery responses is not warranted. The expert
reports produced by the parties shall be full and complete expert
reports in compliance with Rule 26. The Court stated that if
Defendants do not produce an expert report by November 6,
2009, Defendants will not be permitted to present a damages
expert.

you allow other witnesses or other names of hotel owners, I can
try to get them. If not, your answer is correct.

Inn Associates, Lavi reported as to AV Inn Operations as follows:

15

The company sold the property in July, 2009, to avoid incurring
additional loss on the operations of the hotel. The property was
not sold on the basis of its best use which is a hotel property as a
result of the withdrawal of Best Western name but was sold to a
medical college. Lost income on the sale of the property
amounted to $1,300,000.00.

Despite the fact that the real property under the Hotel was owned by AV

(See Dkt. # 36.)

A.
Okay. I tell you what happened to that sale. I picked
that because that was the lowest sales amount that I was offered.
And the guy was an Indian guy. I have his name and number
maybe somewhere. And he was lowballing me. And he was
ready to take Best Western, buy my place with the Best Western
headache. And stood by me for eight, nine months. And he
gave up and left.

19
20

Q.
So all that needed to be done to consummate that deal
was for you to accept the offer?

21

A.

Yes. I wouldn't. It was so cheap.

23

Q.

But did you have other offers?

24

A.

Yes. I had -- I listed it for 8.9 million.

Harooni claims that Terry Wininger, Best Western District Manager,

“induced Mr. Harooni to purchase the hotel after 2 other buyers backed out,” and
“promised to provide support because of his inexperience in the hotel business.” (Ex. J
¶ 11.)

Harooni claims that “[s]ome of the services that Plaintiffs promised

Defendants were pursuant to oral agreement.” (Id. ¶¶ 18, 25, K ¶¶ 11, 18.)

In supplemental responses to Best Western’s discovery, Harooni stated as

follows:

12

16

Ms. Wininger stated Best Western had various support that
would be available to Mr. Harooni to aid him in running the
hotel, including money management, account management,
design help. These representations were made orally during the
initial interview and there are no documents containing these
promises.

17

....

18

The oral agreement was between Terry Wininger and Hooshang
Harooni made on the day of the initial interview for the

Mr. Harooni in running the hotel if he was to purchase the hotel.
Those promises included money management, account

Q. So, specifically, what support did Terri Wininger tell you
Best Western would provide?

12
13

A. Specifically, what I recall was three items. She said three
or four items. She said we have design people standards. She
showed me all of the room, design room, and people working on
design and stuff. That wasn't part of her sales pitch. And she
said we have money manager who monitor your accounts at all
times. That was good just in case anything goes wrong. They

initial meeting between Harooni and Best Western, testified that Wininger explained the

Defendants claimed, in response to an interrogatory, that the inspections

resulting in termination of Defendants’ Best Western membership were “capricious”
and that the Best Western inspector, Mitch Van Wormer (“Van Wormer”), took points
off for items previously approved. (Ex. J ¶ 15.)

In a supplementing response to Best Western’s interrogatories,

Defendants claimed that previously approved items resulted in deductions on the

A.

Yes.

Q.
Turning to the next page BW0431, under the heading
chrome, it says the tub chrome was tarnished in room 180 and

A.

It wasn't tarnished. It was like worn out. But he put

A.
Yes. There was a liquid that I would put on to remove
it, but then it would come back. Once the room was vacant for
one or two weeks, it would build up again.
Q.
So was that a common problem in all of the hotel
rooms?
A.
No, no. It was more of a problem or more of a problem
in the two story because it was older. But they installed all new
toilets.
Q.

Do you know when they installed all new toilets?

A. It was in 2007, I think. When was this inspection? I think
that, when she inspected, they hadn't all been changed yet.
Some but not all.
Q.
Turn to the next page BW0432. Under the heading
Buildings, Roofs, it states, "Roof edge damaged on overhang
near Japanese garden."

Is this the same roof edge damage that had been noted
on the previous inspection reports?

Yes. But it was actually on both sides. It first got it on

one side. And then that was fixed. And then it went to the other
side.

2

Q.
Go down a little further.
There is a heading
Elevators/Lifts Interior or Exterior. And it says, "Elevator
panels have holes and scratches." Do you recall seeing the
holes and scratches?

A.

Are these the same defects with the elevator that had

that people are very mischievous, and they do things.

Maybe some of those children from the soccer and
baseball teams.

A.
Exactly. The soccer. They destroy the hotel when they
come. (In English.)

Q.
And if we go further down, there is a heading, Parking
Lot, Trash Areas, Delivery et cetera. And the inspection report
says that the parking lot has numerous cracks.

Is that an accurate description of the parking lot on the
date of this inspection?

My brother was the painter for the hotel.

Okay. The only thing I have to say, from day one,
whenever Mitch came in, he came out as a friend and was the
nicest guy in the world. And he was friendly enough. And he
was there all the time, I thought, not only as an inspector more
as a friend and a person who patted me on the shoulder and
check up on progress report to see what more have I done.
And he in the whole two-and-a-half years, three years
not even once he said you are doing a bad job. And then the last
time that he was there, and he never showed up. He turned his
face around. And I said, Mitch, what are you doing? I'm selling
the place. He said that is what it is. And he walked away. And
that wasn't him at that time, I'm thinking.
And then I called the headquarters and said to talk to
Terri. I said, Terri, please don't do this to me. What are you
doing? She said. Sorry. The 48 hours has passed. I called him
two, three days later and said you had only 48 hours to get a
reinspection. And I said Terri, you can -- it is out of my hand.
What do you mean out of your hands? That is how it works.

16
17

Q.
My question to you was, what basis do you have to
object to any particular deduction?

That is what I'm objecting because he never treat us like
that to just take off every little point and walk away.

No, I don't want to see it, but I want to explain

there, I called. And I said that inspection was not fair to send
somebody else to reinspect.
Terri Wininger herself told me that 48 hours has passed.
And she cannot send somebody else. And I turned around and
told her then -- I was up to what she is trying to do. And I told
her then I will do it the next time. I remember for next time.
The next time the minute she left, I called. And you
know what they told me. They say we are not coming back
unless you pay a few thousand dollars and request. And then
the only -- we only come to look at our pictures to prove that we
were right.
Then why didn't she tell me that before the last time
talking. So now I object to every single thing that she took off
because Mitch never did that to us. Now the pictures might say
something. But I disagree the way they did the business.

them or something. He opens the door. He touches you. He
does, come on in. Have a sit. He sits you. And he stands right
behind you.
And the people ask you questions. 90 percent of the
questions they ask was how much your hotel is worth? You
want to sell it? Or you don't want to sell it? They were trying
to get information out of me to see if they have a buyer if they
can put me down so somebody buys it cheap if you are asking
me.
I told them in that meeting I have money. I do anything
that is necessary to fix the place. I kiss your foot. I do
anything. Please don't take my livelihood away. I am sick the
minute I said I am sick, I guess they saw the ring. And they put

The Governing Documents include provisions relating to Best Western’s

reservation system. (See Exs. B ¶ 16, D Ch. IV.)
84.

The Governing Documents did not guarantee that Best Western’s

reservation system, including the software and hardware used at the hotel level, will be
free of errors and malfunctions at all times. (See generally Exs. B, C, and D.)
85.

The Membership Agreement recognizes that errors and malfunctions are

bound to occur when it states that the member shall “participate in the troubleshooting
process” should a failure or interruption occur, and that “[i]t shall be the sole
responsibility of Best Western to make final problem determination and dispatch
technical resources as needed to achieve problem resolution,” thereby eliminating any
unrealistic expectation that Best Western’s reservation system may error be proof all of
the time. (See Ex. B ¶ 16.)

The Hotel’s Director of Sales, Lisa Wilkerson (“Wilkerson”), testified as

A.
When I was trying to figure out how to work their
system with having a basic idea how the usual system works,
when I got into it and started poking around, there were some
things that didn't make any sense. No one at the property left
could answer it.
And they called Best Western. And they said Mitch -I have no idea what his last name is. He showed up. And we
sat down together. And we went through some things. And
when we got into the system, there was a problem with not
getting any reservations. And Mitch found that problem when
we stumbled across the -- that the reservation system had been
closed out for the previous three months.

13

Q.

When did you first notice that there was a problem?

It wasn't a problem. I didn't know there was a problem
because I didn't know what I was looking at. He came to teach
me, to understand what it was I was looking at. He was my

Showed me how to monitor the TDS that they have, how to

rooms we had available, how to tell what dates were available.
Just the general everyday use of our reservation system.
