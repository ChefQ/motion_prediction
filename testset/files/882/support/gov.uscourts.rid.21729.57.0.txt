FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
In the course of the proceedings with respect to Defendants’ motions to dismiss, this
Court has already been presented with the facts of this case. Accordingly, Plaintiff will not
restate them in this motion, except to the extent necessary to support the arguments below.
In its Decision and Order dated March 5, 2008, this Court dismissed all of the claims
against all of the Defendants, with prejudice, for lack of personal jurisdiction. Although Plaintiff
asserts that the Decision and Order was incorrect in all respects, mindful of the standard on a
Rule 59 motion that it is not to be interposed solely for the purpose of re-argument, Plaintiff
requests that this Court reconsider two primary issues: (1) the Court made a manifest error of law
in dismissing Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (“GS Group”) for lack of personal jurisdiction; and (2)
the Court made a manifest error of fact and law in dismissing the claims against the Individual
Defendants with respect to the Bridge Financing claims.

STANDARD OF REVIEW
Plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration is filed pursuant to Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure. See National Metal Finishing Co. v. Barclays American/Commercial, Inc.,
899 F.2d 119, 122 (1st Cir.1990) (“Circuit precedent suggests that challenges to the correctness
of a judgment are properly construed as motions under Rule 59(e).”). It is appropriate for a court
to grant a motion to reconsider: “1) where the court made a manifest error of fact or law; 2)
where there is newly discovered evidence; or 3) where there has been a change in the law.”
Murphy v. Maine, 2007 WL 1846777 (D.R.I. 2007) (citing to McLaughlin v. Unum Life Ins. Co.
of America, 212 F.R.D. 40, 41 (D.Me.2002).

A district court has broad discretion in deciding a motion under Rule 59(e). United States
v. Land at 5 Bell Rock Rd., 896 F.2d 605, 611 (1st Cir.1990). To show manifest error of law or
fact, the moving party must demonstrate a substantial reason the court is in error. See DeSenne
v. Jamestown Boat Yard, Inc., 781 F. Supp. 866 (D.R.I. 1991).
In this case, Plaintiff contends that this Court erred as a matter of fact and law in granting
Defendant GS Group’s motion to dismiss and in granting the Individual Defendants’ motion to
dismiss with respect to the Bridge Financing claims.

LEGAL ARGUMENT
I.

The District Court Erred in Granting Defendant GS Group’s Motion to
Dismiss.

In the Decision and Order, the dismissal of GS Group was relegated to a footnote:

Defendant GS Group does have a registered agent for service of process in Rhode
Island. However, Plaintiff has not made any allegation against GS Group, instead
predicating GS Group’s liability, if any, on the activities of the Individual
Defendants. Given that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over the Individual
Defendants, as explained in detail in this opinion, the court sees no justification to
allow the action to proceed against GS Group. Should Plaintiff refile its
Complaint in an appropriate forum, the Individual Defendants and GS Group will
presumably be required to defend themselves in that forum.
Decision, p. 11, n.3.

There is no legal or factual dispute that GS Group has sufficient contacts for the exercise
of general jurisdiction. It is well established that general jurisdiction, once established, extends
to all claims that may be asserted against a defendant. United Elec., Radio and Machine
Workers of America v. 163 Pleasant Street Corp., 960 F.2d 1080, 1088 (1st Cir. 1992). It is
equally well established that a corporation is liable for the actions of its officers, agents and
employees. See Murphy v. Shearson Lehman Brothers, Inc., 42 F.3d 79, 81-2 (1st Cir. 1994)

(noting that agency may be based on apparent authority pursuant to Rhode Island law); Fraoli v.
Lemcke, 328 F.Supp.2d 250, 278 (D.R.I. 2004) (stating that “[a]pparent authority may arise from
indicia of authority given by the principal to the agent and does not have to be in the form of a
direct communication to a third person”); In re Atlantic Financial Management Inc., 784 F. 2d
29, 31-32 (1st Cir. 1986) (corporation may be liable for agent’s misrepresentations); Brimbau v.
Ausdale Equipment Rental Corp., 440 A. 2d 1292, 1295 (R.I. 1982) (finding that a corporation is
responsible for the tortious conduct committed by its agents while acting within the scope of
their authority.) This tenet is true whether the actions of the Individual Defendants occurred
within or outside of the State of Rhode Island, and whether or not there is personal jurisdiction
over the Individual Defendants in Rhode Island.
In its recitation of the facts the Court acknowledged that the Individual Defendants “are
employed by affiliates of GS Group in New York and London.” (Decision, p. 2)
With regard to the employment of the Individual Defendants by “affiliates of GS Group”,
this Court should take judicial notice of the fact that in GS Group’s own press releases, which are
public records found on Goldman Sachs’ website, as of November 25, 2000, Defendants John
Daly and Robert Gheewalla were invited to join the Partnership Pool; as of November 30, 2002
Gerald Cardinale was invited to become a Managing Director; and as of November 24, 2004,
Gerald Cardinale was invited to join the Partnership Pool. (Copies of these press releases are
attached hereto as Exhibit 1). Thus, during the course of the events alleged in Plaintiff’s
Complaint, and elaborated upon in the Affidavit of John Primeau, the Individual Defendants
were more than mere employees, but were integral parts of the GS Group’s management team.
Against this backdrop the Plaintiff’s allegations that each of the Individual Defendants were

4

Case 1:06-cv-00492-S-LDA

Document 57

Filed 03/19/2008

Page 7 of 15

involved in orchestrating the GS Group’s investment and involvement in Clearwire attains
greater jurisdictional significance.
Plaintiff submits that this Court committed a manifest error of law in failing to exercise
jurisdiction over GS Group because it failed to provide a sufficient legal or factual basis for its
decision to decline jurisdiction. In this context, Plaintiff made a showing of requisite minimum
contacts, the burden shifted to the Defendants to show that the exercise of jurisdiction is
otherwise unfair. See Forum Financial Group v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, 173
F. Supp. 2d 72, 87 (D.Me. 2001). Specifically, the “gestalt factors” militate in favor of this
Court exercising jurisdiction over GS Group. With respect to this argument, Plaintiff
incorporates by reference pages 21-24 of its Memorandum in Support of its Objection to the
Motion to Dismiss the Complaint Pursuant to Rules 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(5), previously filed with
this Court as Document 36.
Furthermore, this Court’s finding that there is no basis to assert personal jurisdiction over
the Individual Defendants weighs in favor of asserting jurisdiction over GS Group, inasmuch as
there may be no other forum whereby Plaintiff can obtain redress against these Defendants. At
this point, since the pendency of the proceedings on the motions to dismiss, the statute of
limitations has expired under New York law as to certain of the fraud claims, and possibly as to
the breach of fiduciary duty claims, and the claims brought in Delaware have already been
dismissed on personal jurisdiction grounds. Declining jurisdiction over GS Group in this Court,
which is likely to be the responsible party to indemnify even the claims against the Individual
Defendant, could effectively deprive Plaintiff of its day in court. Accordingly, Plaintiff requests
that this Court reconsider its dismissal of GS Group from this action and exercise jurisdiction
over GS Group.

As a Matter of Law, the District Court Erred in Granting Defendants’
Judgment on the Plaintiff’s Bridge Financing Claims.
A.

The Court Erred in Determining Questions of Fact as the Basis for
Dismissing the Bridge Financing Claims.

The function of a judge facing a motion for judgment for lack of personal jurisdiction is
not to make findings of fact. In considering a Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss for lack of
personal jurisdiction, a district court must construe the facts from the pleadings and affidavits in
the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Boit v. Gar-Tec Products, Inc., 967 F.2d 671, 675-676
(1st Cir. 1992). Moreover, until a full evidentiary hearing or a trial on the merits is held, a
plaintiff need only set forth prima facie evidence of personal jurisdiction. McAleer v. Smith, 728
F. Supp. 857, 861 (D.R.I. 1990).
The First Circuit enumerated the requirements of the prima facie standard in Boit v. GarTec Products, Inc., 967 F.2d 671, 675-676 (1st Cir. 1992). Under this standard a plaintiff is
required to proffer evidence that, if believed, would support the findings of all facts essential to
jurisdiction under both the long-arm statute and the due process clause. Id. at 675. The district
court does not act as a fact finder but accepts the evidence proffered by the plaintiff, and all
reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, as true. Id. Once a plaintiff has provided
affirmative evidence of the propriety of jurisdiction, the court must accept those facts for the
purposes of the motion, even if the movant disputes them. CVS Corporation v. Taubman
Centers, Inc., 225 F. Supp. 2d 120, 123 (D.R.I. 2002). Thus, in applying the prima facie
standard, this Court is required to accept Plaintiff’s affidavit as true. Boit v. Gar-Tec Products,
Inc., 967 F.2d at 679.
In its Decision and Order, this Court improperly made findings of fact with respect to the
undisclosed McCaw deal, finding that Plaintiff’s claim rests on mere conclusory allegations that

6

Case 1:06-cv-00492-S-LDA

Document 57

Filed 03/19/2008

Page 9 of 15

the McCaw negotiations were underway prior to the August bridge offering letters and were not
disclosed to the Plaintiff and other non-insiders. However, since these “conclusory allegations”
were not contradicted by the Defendants, they should have been accepted as true by this Court.
Moreover, the Court overlooked certain salient facts, that should have been viewed in the light
most favorable to the Plaintiff.
Plaintiff’s Complaint alleges at paragraph 47 that “Around the same time of the Investor
Update, in or about the Spring of 2003, the Defendant Directors began discussing a possible sale
of Clearwire, or a sale of substantially all of Clearwire’s assets, with the McCaw Group.” The
Complaint further alleges that this information was not disclosed to the Plaintiff in the context of
the C Round Financing. Complaint, ¶ 49, 53. The Complaint further alleges that the
Defendants controlled Clearwire, such that the communications sent by Clearwire were part of
Defendants’ scheme to defraud Plaintiff. Complaint ¶ 9-13.
Neither the Original Offer nor the Preemptive Rights Offer disclosed the pending McCaw
Sale or any details of that transaction to the minority shareholders. Participation by investors,
including the Defendants, in the C Round of financing raised a mere $600,000. Given the
monthly burn rate of $2.1 million, this was an inconsequential sum, not intended or able to
continue the operations of Clearwire. As the McCaw name was withheld, little reason existed to
participate on the part of the shareholders. (Compl. ¶ 53).
The purported bridge financing was in fact part of a scheme to defraud the minority
stockholders by diluting certain stockholder interests and by limiting participation in the C
Round Financing to Goldman Sachs and the Individual Defendants in anticipation of the pending
McCaw Sale so that they might obtain the benefits of that transaction for themselves.

Case 1:06-cv-00492-S-LDA

Document 57

Page 10 of 15

Without knowledge or understanding that Clearwire’s business was about to engage in the
McCaw Sale, the stockholders would not have seen anything favorable in the recent history of
Clearwire to warrant further investment. Defendants, of course, knew that to be the case and
capitalized upon it. (Compl. ¶ 54).
As set forth in the Affidavit of John Primeau, Goldman Sachs, through Daly, negotiated a
buyout from HITN whereby Goldman Sachs would still retain the spectrum rights. Primeau Aff.
¶ 32. At the time of this deal, HITN’s attorney was Edward (Rudy) Geist. Significantly, in
joining the Stritzinger Complaint (attached as Exhibit F to Goldman Sach’s Memorandum,
Document number 13), Giest also alleged that the McCaw negotiations were in process and not
disclosed. (Stritzinger Complaint, ¶ 27-38)
The Court also found, despite the facts presented to the contrary, that “Plaintiff does not
allege that it made any attempt to inquire about such details or that any person who did inquire
was not informed about the allegedly pending and secret meetings with McCaw.” Decision, p.
23; and that “As with the first letter, Plaintiff has not claimed that it attempted to learn more
about the potential transactions; perhaps if it had, it would have found Clearwire to be perfectly
forthcoming about the potential deal with McCaw.” Decision, p. 24.
As set forth in the Affidavit of John Primeau, NACEPF filed a formal action for Books &
Records under Delaware law in order to better assess the Preemptive Rights Offer but the
information produced did not disclose the potential McCaw sale. Primeau Aff. ¶ 40.
Moreover, when inquiries were made by other shareholders to ascertain the nature of
these “discussions” the ongoing McCaw discussions were not disclosed. In August 2003, John
Schwartz who headed ITF called John Primeau to relate his conversation with Daly on the
pending Bridge Financing. He stated that the main deal with AT&T failed, and that Daly

8

Case 1:06-cv-00492-S-LDA

Document 57

Filed 03/19/2008

Page 11 of 15

discussed other potential parties which included Earthlink, the Clarity Group, Nextwave,
IPCOM, TELMEX and Nextel. No mention was made of the McCaw Group. Primeau Aff. ¶
43. Thereafter, In August 2003, Primeau followed up with his own telephone call to James
Kirkland, attorney for Clearwire, to obtain additional information regarding the “C Round”
Preemptive Rights Offer. Kirkland reiterated to Primeau what was generally related to him by
John Schwartz, namely that the failed AT&T deal was referenced in some detail as was some
potential smaller entities as Earthlink, the Clarity Group, Nextwave, IPCOM, TELMEX and
Nextel. The critical discussions with the McCaw Group were not disclosed. Primeau Aff. ¶ 44.
The list of the disclosures actually served to further the Defendants’ fraudulent concealment of
the McCaw Group as the extensive list left the impression that any efforts to obtain financing or
investment with an entity that was at all noteworthy had been disclosed.
Furthermore, the materiality of the information that was not disclosed is a question of fact
that cannot be resolved on a motion to dismiss. See Rosen v. Textron, Inc., 321 F. Supp. 2d 308,
318 (D.R.I. 2004).
Consequently, this Court’s conclusions regarding jurisdiction over the bridge financing
claims are based upon a mistake of fact which should be reconsidered and vacated by this Court.

B.

The Court Erred as a Matter of Law in Determining the Bridge
Financing Letter Did Not Permit the Exercise of Personal
Jurisdiction over the Defendants.

The Court made a manifest error of law in concluding that the Investor Update and
Bridge Financing offer letters did not permit the exercise of jurisdiction over the Individual
Defendants, as not constituting “purposeful availment” under the jurisdictional analysis.
Decision, pp. 24-25.

Case 1:06-cv-00492-S-LDA

Document 57

Page 12 of 15

The touchstones of purposeful availment are voluntariness and forseeability.
Ticketmaster-New York, Inc. v. Alioto, 26 F.3d 201, 203 (1st Cir. 1994).
The fact that the Individual Defendants at all times knew they were communicating
misrepresentations to a party located in Rhode Island meets the purposeful availment test.
Digital Equipment Corp. v. Altavista Technology, Inc., 960 F. Supp. 456 (D.Mass. 1997) (a
defendant allegedly causing harm in a state has acted purposefully because it has targeted the
forum state and its residents). Since the Individual Defendants specifically intended their
fraudulent misstatements to affect NACEPF in the Rhode Island forum, by inducing NACEPF
not to take part in the bridge financing by failing to disclose the negotiations with McCaw, the
injurious effects sustained by the intended Rhode Island victim are sufficient to meet the
jurisdictional test for purposeful availment. Hahn v. Vermont Law School, 698 F.2d 48
(1st Cir. 1983) (mailing of application and acceptance letter to Massachusetts resident was
purposeful action sufficient for exercise of jurisdiction); New Life Brokerage Services, Inc. v.
Cal-Surance Associates, Inc., 222 F.Supp.2d 94 (D.Me. 2002) (failure to provide critical
information in materials sent to forum resident with whom broker had contract sufficient to
confer personal jurisdiction over breach of fiduciary duty, misrepresentation and fraud claims);
Murphy v. Erwin-Wasey, Inc., 460 F.2d 661 (1st Cir. 1972). This factual predicate clearly meets
the foreseeability test.
Likewise, the Defendants were not coerced or deceived into dealing with a Rhode Island
corporation involuntarily. See Levinger v. Matthew Stuart & Co., Inc., 676 F. Supp. 437, 440
(D.R.I. 1988) (course of dealing supported finding that defendants’ conduct was purposefully
directed toward Rhode Island). Directing the bridge financing letters to NACEPF in Rhode

10

Case 1:06-cv-00492-S-LDA

Document 57

Filed 03/19/2008

Page 13 of 15

Island were voluntary acts intending to induce inaction on the part of a Rhode Island entity, to its
eventual detriment.
The facts alleged in this case comport cases from other jurisdictions that have exercised
jurisdiction based upon fraudulent misrepresentations contained in mailings to the forum state,
where those very representations were intended to induce some action or inaction. See Ashton
Park Apartments, Ltd. v. Lebor, 252 F. Supp. 2d 539 (N.D. Ohio 2003) (representations in
telephone conversations, mail and e-mail directed to forum regarding capacity and intentions to
perform contract were sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction over non resident shareholder);
Agsco Corp. v. Scheer, 1999 WL 1285867 (N.D.Ill. 1999) (distinguishing Young v. ColgatePalmolive, and finding that mailings and telephone calls by non resident into forum with intent to
effect forum resident was a sufficient basis for jurisdiction).
In this regard, the cases cited by the Court in its Decision are readily distinguishable.
First, both cases address jurisdiction under the Illinois long arm statute which permits the
exercise of jurisdiction where the tortious actions occurred within the state. In W.Va Laborer’s
Pension Trust Fund v. Caspersen, 829 N.E. 2d 843 (Ill. App. 2005), the Court would not
exercise personal jurisdiction over a class action against Board members which had sent merger
materials into the forum. The Court’s holding rested on the finding that since the actions related
to the merger occurred outside the forum - failure to undertake proper due diligence - the
dissemination of merger materials in and of themselves did not constitute tortious acts occurring
within the forum to confer jurisdiction under the Illinois statute. Id. at 847-848. Likewise, in
Young v. Colgate Palmolive Co., 790 F.2d 567 (7th Cir. 1986), personal jurisdiction over
directors was denied where the adoption of the allegedly fraudulent poison pill takeover plan
occurred in New York, and mailings describing said plan were sent to shareholders in Illinois. In

11

Case 1:06-cv-00492-S-LDA

Document 57

Filed 03/19/2008

Page 14 of 15

both cases, the mailings to shareholders were insufficient because the primary basis for asserting
jurisdiction was that the effects of acts outside of the jurisdiction were sustained within the
forum.
Here, in contrast, the tortious acts were the misrepresentations and non-disclosures
contained in the letters themselves, which constituted both fraud and breach of fiduciary duty,
intentionally directed to NACEPF in Rhode Island as a principle investor. Moreover, these
communications arose out of a long term business relationship with NACEPF, a Rhode Island
entity, which is sufficient to confer jurisdiction under First Circuit precedent. See Northern
Laminate Sales, Inc. v. Davis, 403 F.3d 14, 25-26 (1st Cir. 2005).

CONCLUSION
For the forgoing reasons, Plaintiff requests that its motion pursuant to Rule 59(e) of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure be granted in all respects and that this Court reconsider and
vacate its entry of Judgment in favor of the Defendants as set forth herein.
