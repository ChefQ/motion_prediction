PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND

{BC00184016:l}

Case 1:18-cv-24227-CMA Document 57 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/11/2019 Page 2 of 23

Plaintiff, Jason Miller ("Miller" or "Plaintiff'), by counsel and pursuant to Rules 15 and
16(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, moves for leave to amend his First Amended
Complaint against Defendants, Gizmodo Media Group, LLC ("Gizmodo"), Katherine Krueger
("Krueger") and Will Menaker ("Menaker"), after the December 19, 2018 deadline to amend
pleadings set forth in this Court's Order Setting Trial and Pre-Trial Schedule, Requiring
Mediation, and Referring Certain Matters to Magistrate Judge [Doc. 19] (the "Scheduling
Order"), and states in support as follows:
INTRODUCTION
Far from being "frivolous," this case presents a clear picture of how people supposedly
acting as "journalists" manipulate the First Amendment to try to insulate themselves from
liability for attacking someone they despise while they generate online views and revenue in the
process. From the outset, Miller alleged he was targeted by Defendants because of his political
associations and their ill-will, greed, and personal animosity. [Doc. 5 ,, 10, 95, 118, 127, 129]
Until December 31, 2018, Miller did not know and could not have known just how deep
Defendants' hatred runs, the full extent of their actual malice, nor what transpired behind the
scenes before Defendants intentionally and knowingly abused the power of speech. It was only
after Defendants' December 31, 2018 discovery responses Miller learned specific details about
Defendant's subjective motivation for attacking him:
He was a top tier scumbag even before

Case 1:18-cv-24227-CMA Document 57 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/11/2019 Page 3 of 23

As is often the case, media defendants are seeking an expedited dismissal of this action
under First Amendment principles before discovery can run its full course.

That request

inherently risks the premature disposition of viable claims before Miller has the benefit of
meaningful discovery of all the facts, including facts which (like those depicted above) are
solely within the Defendants ' knowledge but essential to certain elements of Plaintiffs claims,

including actual malice and personal jurisdiction.
While Menaker in large part stonewalled Miller's jurisdictional discovery and produced
no documents, Defendants Gizmodo and Krueger provided some discovery and documents. The
minimal discovery provided thus far bolsters Miller's existing actual malice and personal
jurisdiction allegations and refutes arguments raised in Krueger's and Gizmodo 's [Doc. 44] and
Menaker's anticipated [Doc. 30] motions to dismiss. In particular, Krueger's recently disclosed
internal communications with Gizmodo and her messages with her boyfriend, 1 Menaker, add
substantial support for Miller's existing actual malice and jurisdictional allegations and
demonstrate the grounds upon which Defendants' have or will argue dismissal is warranted
under the First Amendment lack merit.
This recent discovery revealed not only direct and circumstantial evidence of actual
malice beyond what Miller already plausibly alleged [Doc. 5,

~~

123-143], but new evidence

concerning Gizmodo' s and Krueger's knowledge concerning whether the Supplement they
published was sealed, as well as their knowledge and belief they could not publish sealed court
filings. The recent discovery also revealed Menaker's knowledge of the connections between his

Prior to filing the First Amended Complaint, Miller's counsel researched the potential
romantic relationship between Krueger and Menaker alluded in Menaker's October 16, 2018
tweet, but found conflicting evidence on social media concerning whether they were actually
romantically involved. Consequently, Miller's counsel was not comfortable under Rule 11
alleging they were boyfriend and girlfriend in the First Amended Complaint.

tortious conduct and Florida, as well as his personal, private reasons for his defamatory tweet
about Miller. Although Menaker seeks to shroud his defamatory tweet about Miller in First
Amendment protection by touting his background as a "podcaster and satirist" and "leftist
commentator," and by labeling his defamatory tweet "rhetorical hyperbole" [Doc. 30 pp. 1], the
new evidence demonstrates he was not a disinterested journalist weighing in on an article about a
"prominent conservative political operative" who merely "mocked Miller's litigious behavior in
colorful and clearly sarcastic terms." [Id.] In reality, Menaker defamed Miller for personal
reasons after his girlfriend was sued and because he was angry and despises Miller; and Menaker
did so in concert with Krueger while they pondered how the defamatory tweet would impact this
Florida case:

Miller seeks leave to amend his First Amended Complaint to incorporate these and other
facts learned through recent discovery, as well as facts Miller diligently although recently
determined through an independent investigation into Menaker's Twitter followers (information

[BC00184016: I }

Menaker refused to provide). Miller's proposed amendment also addresses alleged pleading
deficiencies raised in Gizmodo's and Krueger's pending [Doc. 44] and Menaker's anticipated
[Doc. 30] motions to dismiss. To the extent necessary based on Defendants' arguments, Miller's
proposed additional factual allegations provide further support for his claims against Defendants,
refute or resolve factual and legal issues raised in Defendants' motions to dismiss, and further
establish this Court's personal jurisdiction over Menaker and the viability of Miller's defamation
claim against him. Through his proposed Second Amended Complaint, Miller seeks to:
1.

Allege additional facts in support of his allegations that Menaker engaged
in tortious acts in, directed to, and causing harm in the state of Florida;

2.

Allege additional facts in support of his allegations that Menaker's
defamatory tweet was posted with actual malice and is not protected by
the First Amendment; and

3.

Allege additional facts in support of his allegations that Krueger and
Gizmodo acted with actual malice and their knowledge about the court
filing they published about Miller being sealed and that they could not
publish sealed court filings; and

4.

Separately allege claims for Invasion of Privacy by Publication of Private
Facts and Invasion of Privacy by Misappropriation to address arguments
raised by Krueger and Gizmodo.

A copy of Plaintiff's proposed Second Amended Complaint is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.
OVERVIEW OF THE CASE

Miller initially sued Defendants Krueger and Gizmodo for defamation, tortious
interference, intentional infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy, and conspiracy
because they published an article about (the "Article") and a full copy of a fabricated and
defamatory court filing from a Miami-Dade family law case (the "Suppletnent") that was sealed
and exempt from public view. [Doc. 1] Among other things, the Article and Supplement stated
Miller attempted to murder, and killed the unborn child of, one woman, beat another woman, and
tried to cover up these horrific crimes. On October 18, 2018, Miller filed his First Amended

{BC00184016:1}

4

Case 1:18-cv-24227-CMA Document 57 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/11/2019 Page 6 of 23

Complaint to address the diversity of Gizmodo [Doc. 4] and to add Defendant Menaker as a
party and assert a defamation claim against him for posting a tweet on October 16, 2018 stating
Miller is a "baby killer." [Doc. 5]
Miller maintained he was the target of Defendants' tortious attacks for personal, political,
and economic reasons, and because Miller was a prime target for attacks against Trump
supporters, which inflame passions and drive readership. [Doc. 15 ,, 127-130, 117-118, 142143] Miller also alleged Defendants were driven by ill-will and hostility toward Miller. [ld.
,, 127, 118] Miller alleged actual malice and personal jurisdiction over Defendants based on the
limited information available to him at that time concerning their subjective intent and
Menaker's connections in Florida.
Defendants Krueger and Gizmodo moved to dismiss Miller's complaint, arguing Miller
failed to state a cause of action because they are protected by the First Amendment and fair
reporting privilege, and because Miller failed to state viable causes of action for the other torts he
alleged. [Doc. 44] Among other things, Gizmodo and Krueger suggest the Supplement they
published was not sealed and they had no way of knowing it was sealed, as "there has been no
indication whatsoever on the public docket that the Supplement is under seal." [Jd. at p. 2]
Although Miller objects to, disagrees with, and refuted these contentions [Doc. 33], Krueger's
recently produced messages and e-mails (discussed below) show their argument is not accurate. 2

2

Without knowing how the Court will rule on the motion to dismiss [Doc. 44], nor whether the
Court is inclined to consider outside evidence proffered by Gizmodo and Krueger over Miller's
objection [Doc. 53 at p. 3], Miller in part seeks leave to amend as to Gizmodo and Krueger to the
extent the Court is persuaded by their arguments or accepts their evidence and believes Miller's
current allegations against them are insufficient to state a plausible claim for relief. However,
Miller believes his claims against Gizmodo and Krueger are properly pleaded in the First
Amended Complaint.
{BCOOI84016:1}

5

Case 1:18-cv-24227-CMA Document 57 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/11/2019 Page 7 of 23

Defendant Menaker is expected to contest personal jurisdiction and the merits of Miller's
[Doc. 30]

claims.

Menaker may challenge the facial sufficiency of Miller's existing

jurisdictional allegations [ld. at p. 7] and argue his tweet was insufficient to subject him to
jurisdiction in Florida. [Id. at pp. 7-1 0] Menaker may argue he cannot be held liable for his
tweet because it is nonactionable rhetorical hyperbole and protected opinion. [Doc. 30 at pp. 1116] Menaker also may argue Miller failed to plausibly allege actual malice. [Id. at pp. 17-20]
Miller disagrees with each argument and believes the basis for personal jurisdiction and his
defamation claim against Menaker are sufficiently pleaded. However, based on the recently
obtained discovery, Miller now can and seeks leave to allege previously unknown facts that
further support personal jurisdiction over Menaker and the viability of Miller's claim against
him.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
This lawsuit was filed October 15, 2018 [Doc. 1]. Defendants Krueger and Gizmodo
formally agreed to accept service on October 24, 2018 [Doc. 9 and 10]. Menaker was personally
served on October 20, 2018 [Doc. 13].
On November 1, 2018, the parties held an attorney conference pursuant to this Court's
October 24, 2018 Order [Doc. 11]. On November 6, 2018, the parties submitted their Joint
Scheduling Report [Doc. 18], which among other things proposed a deadline of March 11, 2019
to amend or add parties so the parties "can conduct preliminary discovery to determine whether
amendments to the pleadings are necessary." [Doc. 18 at p. 2] On November 7, 2018, the Court

{BCOOI84016:1}

6

Case 1:18-cv-24227-CMA Document 57 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/11/2019 Page 8 of 23

entered her Scheduling Order [Doc. 19] setting December 19, 2018 as the deadline to file
motions to amend pleadings or join parties. 3
On November 30, 2018, Plaintiff served interrogatories, requests for production and
requests for admission on Gizmodo and Krueger; as well as personal jurisdiction interrogatories
and requests for production on Menaker.

On November 30, 2018, Plaintiff also issued

subpoenas for documents to a central non-party, Arlene Delgado ("Delgado"), and her former
counsel. 4

Among other things, those subpoenas sought documents relevant to identifying

Defendants' source of the Supplement
On December 6, 2018, Defendants Krueger and Gizmodo [Doc. 31] and Defendant
Menaker [Doc. 30] filed motions to dismiss. On December 7, 2018, the Court entered her Order
[Doc. 33] denying Defendants' motions to dismiss without prejudice and directing Defendants to
comply with her October 24, 2018 Order [Doc. 12]. The same day, the Court scheduled a
hearing on December 11, 2018 [Doc. 34] to address jurisdictional discovery related to Menaker's
anticipated motion to dismiss. At that hearing, Menaker's counsel noted his objection to the
jurisdictional discovery served by Miller on November 30, 2018. Following the hearing, the
Court issued her Order reinstating Krueger's and Gizmodo's Motion to Dismiss and directing
Miller and Menaker to file joint status reports on the progress of jurisdictional discovery.
[Doc. 40]
On December 19, 2018 [Doc. 48], and by renewed motion filed December 20, 2018
[Doc. 50], Plaintiff moved to extend the deadline to amend pleadings up to and including

3

The trial date is set for the trial term beginning September 3, 2019; the deadline to file pre-trial
motions is set for May 21, 2019; and the deadline to complete mediation is May 13, 2019.
4
Delgado objected, claimed privilege, and refused to produce any responsive documents to
Miller. [Doc. 47] Delgado's former counsel responded that he had no responsive documents.
(See Exhibit 4)
{BCOOI84016:1}

7

Case 1:18-cv-24227-CMA Document 57 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/11/2019 Page 9 of 23

February 19, 2019; noting Defendants' discovery responses were not due until December 31,
2018 and that Delgado objected to her subpoena.

On December 21, 2018, the Court denied

Plaintiffs motion seeking to extend the amendment deadline.

[Doc. 51]

On December 26,

2018, Miller responded to Gizmodo's and Krueger's Motion to Dismiss [Doc. 53]. Gizmodo's
and Krueger's Motion to Dismiss was fully briefed on January 2, 2019 [Doc. 54], and is set for
hearing on January 14, 2019.
NEWLY DISCOVERED EVIDENCE
On December 31, 2018, Gizmo do and Krueger served their written responses to some 5 of
Miller's discovery requests and produced some documents. 6 Among other things, Gizmodo and
Krueger produced:
•

A series of messages between Krueger and Gizmodo Editor Tim
Marchman on Friday, September 21, 2018, before the Supplement was
published, in which Marchman locates the online public docket for
Miller's family case and Marchman and Krueger immediately (and
contrary to their argued position at Doc. 44 p. 2) recognize the Supplement
may be sealed;

•

A string of e-mails between Krueger and Delgado from September 21,
2018 in which Krueger asks if the Supplement is sealed, and in response
Delgado claims (incorrectly) it was not sealed yet but was the subject of
Miller's motion to seal it which was to be heard in the Florida family case
on September 24, 2018;

•

E-mail strings on September 21, 2018, before the Article and Supplement
were published, between Krueger, Gizmodo's in-house legal department,
and Gizmodo's Florida outside counsel of record 7 in this case, which

5

On December 12, 2018, counsel for Krueger and Gizmodo asked for an extension until
January 30, 2019 to respond to Miller's discovery. Miller agreed in part, but insisted Krueger
and Gizmodo to respond to certain discovery requests (those pertinent to the pending and
anticipated motions to dismiss) by the original December 31, 2018 deadline so as to remain
diligent in pursuit of facts that may be necessary to support an amendment.
6
Krueger and Gizmodo objected to Miller's interrogatories and requests for production seeking
information and documents about their source of the Supplement based on journalist shield
privileges. (See Composite Exhibit 5)
7
As alleged in Miller's proposed Second Amended Complaint (Ex. 3), Gizmodo 's outside
counsel is well-versed in Rule 2.420, Fla. R. Jud. Admin., and knew and would have conveyed to

8

Case 1:18-cv-24227-CMA Document 57 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/11/2019 Page 10 of 23

occurred in response to Krueger's and Gizmodo' s concerns (even after emailing Delgado) the Supplement was sealed and their recognition it could
not be published because it was sealed and was subject to Miller's sealing
motion;
•

iMessages between Krueger and Menaker before the Supplement was
published recognizing the accusations in the Supplement are inherently
improbable and also commenting Miller is a "top tier scumbag;" and

•

iMessages between Krueger and Menaker after Krueger learned about
Miller's lawsuit, in which she and Menaker confirm their personal
relationship and ill-will and hostility toward Miller, and then agree
Menaker should publish his October 16, 2018 defamatory tweet for
personal reasons even though it could impact this Florida lawsuit:

On December 31, 2018, Menaker served his responses and objections to Miller's
jurisdictional discovery. (See Exhibit 6) Menaker did not produce any documents. Among
other things, Miller sought information and documents to ascertain:

Menaker's Twitter

followers and which of them were located in Florida; information about Menaker's
communications with Krueger; and Menaker's contacts with Florida. In response, Menaker
directed Miller to search his publicly available list of approximately 82,000 Twitter followers 8
and objected to discovery regarding his communications with Krueger.
In the interim, Miller's outside consultant, Trial Consulting Services, had already been
engaged to complete a review and analysis of Menaker's Twitter followers to identify followers
located in Florida.

(See Exhibit 7)

This process required purchasing a report from an

aggregator, a random sampling verification process, and manual reviews to verify the results.
That work was not completed until January 7, 2019. (!d.) Then, those results had to be (and still
are being) reviewed and cross-checked against Menaker's followers who made impressions on
(or accessed) Menaker's October 16, 2018 tweet. (!d.) So far, Miller has confirmed at least 200
of Menaker's followers have a Florida location and that his defamatory tweet was accessed in
Florida.

8

Menaker has access to functions on his Twitter account as the user that Miller does not. For
example, Menaker can use features to easily access all of his followers' impressions on his tweet.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW

Miller recognizes his obligation to show good cause to amend after the deadline in the
Scheduling Order. John Morrell & Co. v. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., 243 F.R.D. 699 (S.D.
Fla. 2007); Percival v. FAM Trip Tours.com, LLC, 2006 WL 8432181 (S.D. Fla. Jul. 13, 2006).
"Good cause" exists where a scheduling deadline could not have been met despite the movant's
diligent efforts to do so. John Morrell & Co., 243 F.R.D. at 701 (citing Thomas v. Town of
Davie, 847 F.2d 771, 773 (11th Cir. 1988); Johnson v. Mammoth Recreations, Inc., 975 F.2d

604, 609 (9th Cir. 1992).
"Diligence" is evaluated by considering: (1) whether plaintiff failed to ascertain facts
prior to filing the Complaint and to acquire information during the discovery period; (2) whether
the information supporting the proposed amendment was available to plaintiff; and (3) whether
even after acquiring the information the plaintiff delayed in seeking amendment.

Kernal

Records Oy v. Mosley, 794 F.Supp.2d 1355, 1369 (S.D. Fla. 2011) (citing Auto-Owners Ins. Co.
v. Ace Elec. Serv., Inc., 648 F.Supp.2d 1371, 1375 (M.D. Fla. 2009)). If good cause is shown

through diligence, amendment should be given freely when justice so requires, in the absence of
undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, repeated failures to cure pleading deficiencies, undue
prejudice, futility, etc. Hurtado v. Raly Development, Inc., 281 F.R.D. 696, 700 (S.D. Fla. 2012).
Miller was diligent in ascertaining available facts before filing the Complaint and in
acquiring the information upon which amendment is sought during the discovery period, which
only recently began. Virtually all of the information supporting the proposed amendment was
not available to plaintiff before discovery (with the exception of Menaker's Twitter followers'
locations and their impressions on his tweet - which Miller diligently hired an outside consultant
to research and verify and was an involved and time consuming process).

{BC00184016:1 }

11

After acquiring

Case 1:18-cv-24227-CMA Document 57 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/11/2019 Page 13 of 23

Defendants' discovery responses on December 31, 2018, conducting extensive legal research
based on those newly discovered facts and the many nuanced constitutional argutnents raised in
the motions to dismiss, and incorporating those facts and the law into this motion and his
proposed Second Amended Complaint, Miller promptly sought leave to amend within 11 days.
Unlike the plaintiff in Kernal Records, Miller is not waiting to see how the court rules
before seeking leave. 794 F.Supp.2d at 1370. The discovery responses Miller received on
December 31, 2018 revealed new material facts Miller was unable to uncover outside formal
discovery in this lawsuit. In particular, Miller's discovery sought communications between and
amongst the Defendants and non-parties and information about Defendants' subjective intent that
Miller had no way of obtaining absent formal discovery powers.
Consequently, Miller was unable to amend by the deadline because responses to the
discovery he served on November 30, 2018 were not yet due. Miller was not dilatory in serving
his initial discovery requests. They were served just over three weeks after the Scheduling Order
was entered, and before Defendants had even formally moved to dismiss or answered Miller's
Complaint.
Miller recognizes the filing of a complaint is not an invitation to engage in a fishing
expedition to establish a plausible claim for relief. [Doc. 51] Indeed, Miller maintains his First
Amended Complaint already meets the Iqbal and Twombly standard, 9 even though cases
involving the First Amendment-much like cases involving personal jurisdiction challenges-

9

A plaintiffs burden to plausibly allege elements of a cause of action is "exceedingly low."
Williams v. Jeremiah's International Trading Co., Inc., 2009 WL 1587216 (M.D. Fla. June 5,
2009); Elias v. Rolling Stone, LLC, 872 F.3d 97, 111 (2d Cir. 2017) (Lohier, J., concurring in
part and dissenting in part) ("[A]s the majority points out, the plausibility threshold is
exceedingly low.") (citing Anderson News, L.L.C. v. Am. Media, Inc., 680 F.3d 162, 184-85 (2d
Cir. 2012); Workneh v. Super Shuttle Int'l, Inc., 2017 WL 1185221, *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28,

Case 1:18-cv-24227-CMA Document 57 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/11/2019 Page 14 of 23

involve many critical facts a plaintiff cannot learn through reasonable diligence before a suit is
filed.
In cases such as this one, where actual malice is an element of a claim and the full factual
context surrounding challenged speech are at play, the defendant's subjective intent is a central
issue. By nature, facts concerning a publisher's subjective mental state are not reasonably
available before a lawsuit is filed. "Malice may be proved inferentially because it is a matter of
the defendant's 10 subjective mental state, revolves around facts usually within the defendant's
knowledge and control, and rarely is admitted." Celie v. Filipino Reporter Enters. Inc., 209 F.3d
163, 183 (2d Cir. 2000).
The new facts Miller discovered provide direct and circumstantial evidence of
Defendants' subjective intent and additional support for Miller's existing actual malice
allegations and allegations surrounding the context of Defendants' speech.

A plaintiffs

allegations of direct and circumstantial facts must be viewed in totality to determine whether
they plausibly set forth knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth. Celie, 209 F.3d
at 183 ("There is no doubt that evidence of negligence, of motive and of intent may be adduced
for the purpose of establishing, by cumulation and by appropriate inferences, the fact of a
defendant's recklessness or of his knowledge of falsity."). The totality of these circumstances
includes, among other factors: bias or ill-will; motive; failure to investigate; a predetermined
and preconceived plan to malign plaintiffs character; refusals to retract; and inherently
improbable defamatory statements. Connaughton, 491 U.S. at 668; Celie, 209 F.3d at 183; Hunt

10

Defendants "are prone to assert their good-faith belief' in their actions and "plaintiffs will
rarely be successful in proving awareness of falsehood from the mouth of the defendant
himself," and thus plaintiffs necessarily rely on circumstantial evidence to allege and prove their
claims. Herbert v. Lando, 441 U.S. 153, 170 (1979); Harte-Hanks Commc'ns, Inc. v.
Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657, 668 (1989).

Here, Miller already alleged many of these factors [Doc. 5 ~~ 123-143, 118] and believes
his existing allegations are legally sufficient to state plausible claims for relief against all
Defendants. Menaker argued otherwise [Doc. 30 pp. 17-20]. To the extent the Court may agree,
Miller now can and seeks leave to allege additional facts learned through the recent discovery to
further demonstrate Menaker's actual malice. Specifically, Menaker's and Krueger's iMessages
about Miller are direct and circumstantial evidence of bias, ill-will, motive, and a preconceived
plan to malign Miller that combined with other alleged facts support a finding of actual malice.
Connaughton, 491 U.S. at 668; Celie, 209 F.3d at 183; Shoen, 48 F.3d at 417; Duffy, 44 F.3d at

315 n.10; Biro, 807 F.3d at 546; Goldwater, 414 F.2d at 337. Menaker's preconceived plan to
malign Miller and deliberate or purposeful avoidance of the falsity of his defamatory tweet
further support a finding of actual malice. Goldwater, 414 F.2d at 337; Harris, 152 F.App'x. at
568; Gertz, 680 F.2d at 539; Alioto, 519 F.2d at 780-81; Sharon, 599 F.Supp. at 576; Sisemore,
662 F.Supp. at 1536; Tosti, 476 N.E.2d at 936.
Actual malice also can be inferred from the relation of the parties, the circumstances
attending the publication, the terms of the publication itself, and from the words or acts of the
defendant before, at, or after the time of the communication. DR Partners v. Floyd, 228 S.W.3d
493, 498 (Tex. App. - Texarkana 2007) (citing Proctor & Gamble Mfg. Co. v. Hagler,
880 S.W.2d 123, 126 (Tex. App.- Texarkana), writ denied, 884 S.W.2d 771 (Tex. 1994); Ball v.
E. W Scripps Co., 801 S.W.2d 684, 686-87 (1990) (evidence of bias or hostility lends evidence to

other circumstances showing actual malice including holding a grudge).

Here, the recent

discovery shows Menaker held a personal grudge against Miller because Miller sued his
girlfriend, and that in words before and at the time of his defamatory tweet Menaker acted out of
ill-will, hostility, and bias toward Miller.

Case 1:18-cv-24227-CMA Document 57 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/11/2019 Page 17 of 23

Krueger's and Gizmodo's recently produced internal communications also reveal direct
and circumstantial evidence of their serious doubts about the inherent improbability and
seriousness of the accusations in the Supplement, as well as their knowledge they could not
publish sealed court filings, serious doubts (if not actual knowledge) about whether the
Supplement was sealed, actual or imputed knowledge through their counsel the Supplement was
sealed, and their rush to publish the Supplement with a grossly inadequate investigation and for
no legitimate reason. St. Amant, 390 U.S. at 732; Dalbec, 828 F.2d at 927; Vasquez, 85 A.D.2d
at 792; Hunt, 720 F.2d at 645; Bensinger, 713 F.3d at 1057-58; Butts, 388 U.S. at 158.
The new facts also are relevant to Gizmodo's and Krueger's argument Miller's nondefamation claims are barred by the single action rule. For example, Krueger's October 16, 2018
agreement with Menaker to post his defamatory tweet served a purpose of reinforcing Krueger's
original publication of the Defamatory Article and Supplement. Essentially, Krueger enlisted her
boyfriend to use his large Twitter following to confirm that Miller is indeed a "baby killer," as
first professed in her Defamatory Article.
The newly discovered evidence concerning Menaker's personal and private motivations
when he defamed Miller also lends further support to Miller's defamation claim. Specifically,
the Supreme Court recognizes speech concerning a personal dispute cannot be disguised as
speech about matters of legitimate public concern to be shielded from liability.

Connick v.

Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 148 (1983). Where the circumstances surrounding a defamatory statement
are alleged to show the statement was uttered as a personal attack and that a defendant's claimed
commentary on public matters was merely contrived to try to insulate speech on a private matter
from liability, there is no first amendment protection. Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U.S. 443, 455
(2011).

[BC00184016:l}

Case 1:18-cv-24227-CMA Document 57 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/11/2019 Page 18 of 23

Speech uttered incident to a personal dispute is not constitutionally protected. Connick,
461 U.S. at 148, 153-54. As Justice Alito recognized in his dissent in Snyder:
This Court has recognized that words may "by their very utterance
inflict injury" and that the First Amendment does not shield
utterances that form "no essential part of any exposition of ideas,
and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit
that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social
interest in order and morality." Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,
315 U.S. 568, 572 (1942); see also Cantwell v. Connecticut,
310U.S. 296,310 (1940) ("[P]ersonal abuse is not in any proper
sense communication of information or opinion safeguarded by the
Constitution.").
562 U.S. at 465.
Here, like in Gersh v. Anglin, 2018 WL 5962480, *4 (D. Mont. Nov. 14, 2018), Miller
now can assert previously unknown facts through which he can plausibly allege Menaker's
speech "involved a matter of strictly private concern," and that Menaker's "speech on public
matters [if any] was intended to mask an attack ... over a private matter." These new facts also
demonstrate Menaker tried to tum his personal hostilities into a "cause celebre." !d.
As for personal jurisdiction over Menaker, the discovery Miller recently obtained along
with his own investigation into the location of Menaker's Twitter followers (which Menaker
refused to disclose) revealed new facts solidifying jurisdiction. Through personal jurisdiction
discovery, Miller confirmed Menaker's knowledge this lawsuit and Miller's paternity case were
pending in Florida. (See Ex. 6, Int. Nos. 5-7) Miller also confirmed Menaker has Twitter
followers in Florida and that those followers accessed his defamatory tweet.

(See Ex. 7)

Krueger's document production also revealed she and Menaker worked in concert with one
another to defame Miller for personal reasons despite Menaker's recognition the defamatory
tweet could impact this lawsuit in Florida. (See Ex. 2)

Case 1:18-cv-24227-CMA Document 57 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/11/2019 Page 19 of 23

This District recently analyzed personal jurisdiction in the context of a defamatory
online article in Gubarev v. Buzzfeed, Inc., Case No. 1:17-cv-60426-UU [Doc. 27] (May 22,
2017). Applying the same long-arm statute and due process analysis from Gubarev, Miller can
now allege a more comprehensive factual basis to establish Menaker committed a tortious act
within Florida or a tortious act outside Florida that caused injury to Miller in Florida, that
Miller's claim against Menaker arises out of Menaker's contacts with Florida, and that
Menaker's tortious act was aimed at Florida and caused harm to Miller that Menaker should have
anticipated would be suffered in Florida. !d. at pp. 5-20 (citing Madara v. Hall, 916 F.2d 1510,
1515 (11th Cir. 1990); Wendt v. Horowitz, 822 So.2d 1252, 1253 (Fla. 2002); Internet Solutions
Corp. v. Marshall, 39 So.3d 1201, 1215 (Fla. 2010); Louis Vuitton Malletier, S.A. v. Mosseri,
736 F.3d 1339, 1355 (11th Cir. 2013); Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783 (1984); Licciardello v.
Lovelady, 544 F.3d 1280, 1284 (11th Cir. 2008); Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770
(1984). Miller also has a factual basis to allege jurisdiction based on the location of Menaker's
Twitter followers combined with other case-related facts demonstrating Menaker expressly
aimed his tweet at Florida. Boddy v. Pourciau, 2018 WL 4637380, *6-7 (W.D. Wash. Sept. 27,
2018). Menaker has approximately 200 Twitter followers in Florida, some of which accessed his
defamatory tweet. His defamatory tweet was about Miller in the context of this lawsuit in
Florida and Miller's paternity case pending in Florida, which involves Miller's minor son in
Florida, Miller's reputation in Florida, and Miller's parental and visitation rights in Florida.
Through his proposed amendment, Miller also seeks to address arguments raised by
Defendants concerning the legal sufficiency of his First Amended Complaint in a timely manner.
For example, Miller seeks leave to separately allege causes of action for invasion of privacy by
publication of private facts and invasion of privacy by misappropriation (see Ex. 3, Counts IV

{BC00184016:1}

18

Case 1:18-cv-24227-CMA Document 57 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/11/2019 Page 20 of 23

and V) in response to arguments raised by Gizmodo and Krueger [Doc. 44, pp. 17-18; Doc. 54,
pp. 9-1 0]. Miller seeks leave to amend to bolster his actual malice allegations against Menaker
(see Ex. 3, ~~ 139-147) in response to his anticipated arguments [Doc. 30, pp. 17-20].

Miller also seeks leave to allege new, recently discovered facts addressing Menaker's
contention his tweet was rhetorical hyperbole or pure opinion [Doc. 30, pp. 11-16]. Menaker's
personal relationship with Krueger, his messages with her surrounding his tweet, and his actual
malice (see Ex. 3 ~~ 139-147, 169-181) provide additional context to properly evaluate whether
Connick, 461 U.S. at 148; Snyder, 562 U.S. at 455;

Menaker's tweet is protected speech.

Florida Medical Center, Inc. v. New York Post Co., Inc., 568 So.2d 454, 458-459 (Fla. 4th DCA

1990) (discussing opinion and rhetorical hyperbole and how statements containing provably false
factual connotations or implications of false and defamatory facts are treated); Cianci v. New
Times Publishing Co., 639 F.2d 54, 60-65 (2d Cir. 1980) (recognizing liability for accusations of

criminal activity, even in the form of opinion, and liability for re-publication); Friedman v.
Bloomberg, L.P., 884 F.3d 83, 96-97 (2d Cir. 2018) (district court's dismissal of defamation

claim as rhetorical hyperbole reversed because "extort" was reasonably capable of meaning
plaintiff actually committed criminal act).
Miller respectfully requests leave to file his proposed Second Amended Complaint
(Ex. 3) so he can support all of his claims and jurisdictional allegations with newly discovered
facts that were previously unavailable to him. These new facts provide a clearer picture of why
and how Miller was attacked and Defendants' subjective knowledge and intent when they
defamed him, invaded his privacy, intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon him, and
interfered with his ability to earn a living and support his family. They also show why Menaker
is subject to jurisdiction in Florida.

{BCOOI84016:1}

It is fair and reasonable that Miller be permitted an

19

Case 1:18-cv-24227-CMA Document 57 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/11/2019 Page 21 of 23

opportunity in the very early stages of this litigation to allege all of the facts of which he is aware
to support his claims and address the reasons why Defendants argue his claims should be
dismissed.
Miller has not acted in bad faith or with dilatory motive, nor undue delay. He has not
failed to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed. The amendment he seeks will not
prejudice Defendants and is not futile. Over the past two months, Miller has diligently pursued
discovery and a time-consuming independent investigation of jurisdictional facts through an
outside consultant, while also responding to Gizmodo's and Krueger's dismissal arguments and
researching and evaluating Menaker's anticipated arguments (including over and actually on the
intervening holidays), and promptly incorporated the fruits of those efforts into this motion and
his proposed Second Amended Complaint.
This case involves a significant number of fact intensive, complex legal issues
surrounding the First Amendment that do not lend themselves to bare-bones pleadings; as well as
numerous legally-significant facts Miller had no way of knowing or discovering until
December 31, 2018. To suggest that Miller's counsel has not been extremely diligent in the
pursuit of the facts upon which amendment is sought and in the incorporation of those facts into
his proposed amended pleading based on extensive and exhaustive research on complex
constitutional issues and First Amendment pleading requirements simply would not accurate.
CONCLUSION

Miller has good cause and thereupon respectfully requests, to the extent necessary, leave
to allege recently discovered facts in support of personal jurisdiction over Menaker and to
address any pleading deficiencies argued by Defendants the Court may believe to exist.
