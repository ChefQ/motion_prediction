UNITED STATES’ RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO GORDON’S
MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF BOND
1.

Gordon has filed a pleading styled “Motion for Reconsideration of Bond.” For reasons
discussed below, the motion is not one for reconsideration for bond, which is a misnomer. In
fact, because this Court issued its most recent bond order on November 6, 2015 and the order
became final because it was not appealed, this is a motion to reopen the bond hearing
pursuant to Title 18, United States Code, Section 3142 (f). For purposes of responding to
Gordon’s motion, these portions of the record are relevant:
a. On September 30, 2015, Gordon appeared before the Honorable Patricia S. Harris and,
together with his girlfriend and his mother, made certain representations to the Magistrate
Judge that Gordon was living with his father at the father’s residence in Iowa and could
continue to do so until trial. Upon information and belief, Gordon represented to the
court that he was either employed or had employment available to him in Iowa if he were
allowed to return. Both the Magistrate Judge and counsel for the United States accepted
those representations. Without objection from the United States, the Court issued bond
papers placing Gordon on home detention with electronic monitoring at the father’s Iowa
residence and included an employment provision as an additional condition. See Docket
#19-23. See also Order, Docket #26.
b. After the hearing was concluded, it was almost immediately discovered that the

Case 4:15-cr-00095-KGB Document 60 Filed 07/25/16 Page 2 of 6

representations made by Gordon and on his behalf were not accurate and Gordon was
then detained pending trial with the proviso that Gordon could request the Court to revisit
the issue of bond if he were able to make suitable arrangements for release. Docket #25,
26.
c. On October 26, 2015, Gordon’s attorney at the time filed a motion for bond hearing.
Docket #42.
d. A two hour contested bond hearing was conducted on November 6, 2015 at which time
the United States put on testimony and evidence, including photographs and evidence
taken from a transcript of Gordon’s co-defendant in this matter, his cousin Turod Jacobs,
which implicated Gordon in a kidnapping, aggravated assault and theft, the victim of
which was a disabled elderly veteran. As the court will recall, there was circumstantial
and direct evidence which proved by clear and convincing evidence that the victim was
forcibly taken by two black males who had bandana face masks on from his home in
Osceola with cuts and later bruising; he was blindfolded and his hands were tied and he
was placed in his truck in Osceola and driven from there to Little Rock; while traveling
from Osceola, his assailants and kidnappers stopped at an ATM and used his ATM card;
he was ultimately found in west Little Rock in the truck; Gordon and at least one other
person went to Turod Jacob’s apartment carrying a safe that had been stolen from the
victim which contained cash and firearms which were removed from the safe after
Gordon and Jacobs broke open the safe; and the cash and firearms were distributed
among those present, including Jacobs and Gordon who were both felons and who,
therefore, could not legally possess the firearms. Jacobs told the interviewing detective
that Gordon had described some of the foregoing events to him. Upon information and

Case 4:15-cr-00095-KGB Document 60 Filed 07/25/16 Page 3 of 6

belief, there was additional evidence from the testifying United States Probation Officer
that Gordon had been dishonest about his living situation with his supervising state
officer. See Docket #46-47.
e. Upon information and belief, at the November 6, 2015 hearing, Gordon offered the
testimony of a relative, and she and possibly other relatives were offered as third party
custodians. Electronic monitoring or home detention as well as employment were
proposed.
f. The Court entered its written Order affirming its oral finding that, based upon the
evidence and argument of the parties, there [were] no conditions or [a] combination of
conditions of release to reasonably ensure the safety of the community and remanded
Gordon to the custody of the United States Marshal. Docket#47.
g. Thereafter, no further action took place concerning the Magistrate Judge’s factual
findings and legal conclusions.
2. Now, Gordon seeks a reconsideration of his bond conditions citing Title 18, United States
Code, Section 3142(g) and arguing that “new information” justifies another court proceeding
concerning bond pending trial. Gordon claims this “new information” includes; A) proposed
third party custodians, including his mother and grandmother; B) the same employment in
which he was previously engaged in Iowa; C) his demonstration that he is not a flight risk
because he has appeared in court when requested and his ability to adhere to strict conditions
imposed by the Court; D) his lack of significant problems while detained; E) his lack of
previous violent criminal convictions; F) a willingness to be placed on electronic monitoring;
and G) testimony from responsible members of the community that he would not pose a
danger to the community nor would be a flight risk.

3. It is true that a bond hearing “may” be reopened before or after a bond determination by this
Court before trial, but reopening the issue of bond is limited to considering (1) relevant
information not known to the movant at the time of the original hearing and then (2) only to
information not known to the movant that has a material bearing on the issue as to whether
there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as
required and the safety of any other person and the community. See Title 18, United States
Code, Section 3142 (f)(B).
4. “As written, the reopening provision is, in effect, a codification of a court’s inherent
reconsideration authority tempered by the understanding that, to promote finality, preserve
judicial resources, and discourage piecemeal presentations, a court should not reconsider a
decision based on information that could have been presented the first time around.” United
States v. Pon, No. 3:14-cr-75-J-39PDB, 2014 WL3340584, at*24 (D. MD Fla.May 29,
2014)(citing Lederman v. United States, 539 F.Supp. 2d 1, 2 (D.D.C. 2008). “Under the
provision [of 18 U.S.C. Section 3142(f)(B), reopening is unwarranted if the newly offered
evidence was available at the time of the hearing.” Pon at *24(citing United States v. Dillon,
938 F.2d 1412, 1415 (1st Cir. 1991);(United States v. Hare, 873 F.2d 796, 799 (5th Cir. 1989);
United States v. Petters, Crim. No. 08-364(RHK/AJB), 2009 WL 205188, at *4 (D.
Minn.Jan. 28, 2009)(citing United States v. Archambault, 240 F. Supp. 2d 1082, 1084
(D.S.D. 2002); United States v. Havens, 487 F. Supp.2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2007); United
States v. Alonso, 832 F. Supp. 503, 504-05 (D.P.R. 1993)). Even then, reopening is
discretionary with the court. Pon at *24 (citing United States v. Watson, 475 F. App’x 598,
599-600 (6th Cir. 2012).
5. Virtually all of the “new evidence” cited by Gordon is, in fact, not “new evidence” at all. If

Case 4:15-cr-00095-KGB Document 60 Filed 07/25/16 Page 5 of 6

recollection serves the undersigned correctly, both the grandmother in Iowa and Gordon’s
mother have been previously proposed to the court as third party custodians. Gordon’s
employment prospects were offered. Short of escape, Gordon’s detention assures his court
appearance; nothing about the fact that he has been successfully locked up for the last eight
months guarantees that he will later show up in court if he is released or that he will not pose
a danger to the community in the interim. Similarly, his deportment while in a custodial
setting does nothing to guarantee his conduct if not detained. Gordon has previously argued
to the court that his lack of violent convictions makes him suitable for release pending trial.
But that argument is belied by evidence that the United States put on of violence inflicted on
the disabled veteran when he was assaulted, kidnapped and robbed. Moreover, Gordon has
already argued that he is a suitable candidate for electronic monitoring and it is the
undersigned’s recollection that his family member, who previously served in the armed
forces, and who testified at the November 6, 2015 bond hearing, testified that she could
ensure community safety and his appearance at court proceedings. Virtually every factor that
Gordon proposes as “new” was previously proffered to this Court to warrant his release
pending trial. If Gordon has comported himself well while detained, which appears to be the
only “new information” if true, that is not material to his release in light of the record as a
whole.
6. The United States recognizes that Gordon’s newly appointed counsel did not participate in
the prior proceedings. But the fact remains that the parties have already litigated the
propriety of Gordon’s release pending trial, that the United States met its burden of proof
resulting in an Order which was not appealed, and there is no factual or legal predicate for
reopening the proceedings where Gordon offers no new evidence or argument having a

Case 4:15-cr-00095-KGB Document 60 Filed 07/25/16 Page 6 of 6

material bearing on the issue of bond.
THEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons and citations to authority, the United States
respectfully requests that Gordon’s motion be denied.
Respectfully submitted,
