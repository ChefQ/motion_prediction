TERENCE GORDON

DEFENDANT

MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF BOND
Comes the Defendant, Terence Gordon, through his attorney, Lott Rolfe IV,
to move the Court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3142 to review and reconsider the denial
of bond after his detention hearing on November 5, 2015. The Defendant has been
in federal custody since September 30, 2015. Counsel for the Defendant was
appointed on April 13, 2016. Counsel for the Defendant did not represent him at
the previous detention hearing. A jury trial in this matter is currently scheduled for
January 23, 2017.
1.

At his prior detention hearing, it was determined that the Defendant

should be detained because it was believed that he would be a danger to the
community and that no conditions could be set to insure the safety of the
community.
2.

Defendant wishes to present, what he believes, is new information that

would support a reconsideration of the decision to detain him pending trial pursuant
to 18 U.S.C. §3142(g).

3.


Among the new factors that the Court should consider are the following:

The Defendant’s grandmother, Anita Wilks, of Burlington, Iowa, remains in
position to serve as his third party custodian. If the Court wishes to have
someone with closer ties to Arkansas, then his mother, Tina Gordon of
Luxora, Arkansas, would also be willing to serve as a third party custodian.



The Defendant, prior to his arrest, was working at Jefferson Bakery in
Burlington, Iowa. If he is released, the job would still be available for him.



The Defendant has demonstrated that he is not a flight risk in that he has
appeared in Court when requested and has the ability to adhere to strict
conditions that are imposed by the Court.



Since his detention, the Defendant has not had any significant problems and
has not been a threat to himself or other inmates.



Defendant informs Counsel that he has no violent criminal convictions that
would support his continued detention pending trial.



Defendant is willing to be placed on electronic monitoring and will adhere to
the strictest of conditions set by the Court.



Responsible members of the community will testify that he would not pose a
danger to the community and would not be a flight risk.

4. Based on the facts set out above, the Defendant submits that he is not a
flight risk and that his release would not pose a danger to the community.
WHEREFORE, Defendant prays that his request for a reconsideration of his
bond be granted and that an immediate detention hearing be held to resolve this
issue.
Respectfully submitted,
