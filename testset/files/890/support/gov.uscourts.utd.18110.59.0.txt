direct entry of the judgment as a final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure.
STATEMENT OF FACTS

The facts material to this motion are as follows:

1. On August 2, 2005, the Court entered its Memorandum Decision and Order
("Order''). On p. 9 of the Order, the Court granted Steimke's Motion For Partial Summary Judgment
seeking judgment against Frank L. Davis, Harvest Marketing, LLC and First Harvest, LLC ("Davis
Defendants") for amounts due under the Davis Note. The motion sought judgment for the principal
amount of the note, plus late fees/interest at the rate of $1,000 per week after March 3, 2000 (the due
date of the note) plus costs and attorneys' fees. The award of attorneys' fees and costs was based
upon the Davis Defendants' promise in the Davis Note to pay all attorneys' fees and costs incurred
in collecting on the note. (See Order, pp. 4 through 10; also Affidavit of David M. Wahlquist, para.
2)

2. The principal amount of the note is $175,000. (See Order, p. 4; also Affidavit of
David M. Wahlquist, para. 3)

3. The late fees/interest accruing after March 3, 2000 through September 29, 2005 is
$290,000. (Affidavit of David M. Wahlquist, para. 4)

4, Steimke hired Kirton & McConkie to assist her in this action to collect on the Davis
Note. Because of the risk involved and Steimke's financial circumstances, she engaged Kirton &
McConkie on a contingency fee basis. Steimke entered into a written agreement wherein she agreed

to pay Kirton & McConkie a one-third contingency fee and to reimburse Kirton & McConkie for all

2

 

 
Case 2:03-cv-00487-DAK Document 59 Filed 08/17/05 Page 3 of 30

out-of-pocket costs, including but not limited to costs for copying, long distance telephone,
deposition costs, travel costs, computer research costs, postage, and filing fees. (Affidavit of David
M. Wahiquist, para. 5)

5. The total judgment exclusive of attorneys' fees and costs is $465,000. One third of
that amount is $155,000 which Steimke will incur as attorneys' fees under her contingency fee
arrangement with Kirton & McConkie. (Affidavit of David M. Wahlquist, para. 6)

6. Attached as Exhibit "A" to the Affidavit of David M. Wahlquist is an accurate
accounting of time spent by attorneys and legal assistants on behalf of Steimke. Also included with
that exhibit is a summary of hours spent by individual attorney and legal assistant and the charges
Steimke would have owed Kirton & McConkie for these services (exclusive of interest) if she had
engaged Kirton & McConkie on an hourly basis at Kirton & McConkie's current hourly rates.
(Affidavit of David M. Wahiquist, para. 7)

7. Plaintiffs in collection actions such as this one frequently engage legal counsel on a
contingency fee basis. There are local attorneys whose sole practice is to collect amounts due on
various instruments exclusively on a contingency fee basis. At the time Frank Davis signed the
Davis Note, he should have reasonably anticipated that plaintiff may engage her counsel on a
contingency fee basis in the event she was compelled to commence legal action to enforce the note.
(Affidavit of David M. Wahlquist, para. 8)

8. Although some contingency fees are higher, a one-third contingency fee is standard

in this community. (Affidavit of David M. Wahlquist, para. 9)
 

Case 2:03-cv-00487-DAK Document 59 Filed 08/17/05 Page 4 of 30

9. Steimke has also incurred costs in this matter in the amount of $6,784.73. An
accurate itemization of those costs is attached as Exhibit "B" to Mr. Wahlquist's Affidavit.
(Affidavit of David M. Wahlquist, para. 10)

10. The total amount due Steimke under the Davis Note as of September 29, 2005 will
be $626,784.73 together with interest/late charges thereafter at the rate of $1,000 per week until paid
in full. (Affidavit of David M. Wahlquist, para. 11)

11. The Court's Order constitutes a complete adjudication of the Eighteenth Cause of
Action set forth in Steimke's complaint. (Affidavit of David M. Wahlquist, para. 12)

13. Steimke stipulates and represents to the Court that she is willing to dismiss all other
causes of action in her complaint as against Frank L. Davis, Harvest Marketing, LLC and First
Harvest, LLC to become effective upon the Court's Order with respect to the Eighteenth Cause of
Action becoming final and non-appealable. Only if the Order is reversed on appeal would she retain
her other claims against said defendants. (Affidavit of David M. Wahlquist, para. 13)

ARGUMENT
I. STEIMKE IS ENTITLED TO JUDGMENT AGAINST THE DAVIS
DEFENDANTS IN THE AMOUNT OF $626,784.73 PLUS $1,000 PER WEEK
AFTER SEPTEMBER 29, 2005 UNTIL PAID IN FULL

The Court has awarded Steimke judgment against each of the Davis Defendants for the
principal amount of the Davis Note ($175,000), plus late fees/interest, plus Steimke's attorneys' fees
and costs. The late fees/interest will total $290,000 through September 29, 2005. (Affidavit of
David M. Wahlquist, para. 3) Steimke's costs incurred in this action total $6,784.73. (Affidavit of

David M. Wahlquist, para. 9)
 

Case 2:03-cv-00487-DAK Document 59 Filed 08/17/05 Page 5 of 30

Steimke has incurred attorneys' fees in the amount of $155,000, which is one-third of the
amount due under the Davis Note exclusive of attorneys' fees and costs. Steimke's attorneys' fees
are based upon a contingency fee agreement with Kirton & McConkie wherein she agreed to pay

costs plus a standard one-third contingency fee. (Affidavit of David M. Wahlquist, para. 4) Since
the award of fees is based upon a Utah state law claim, the amount of fees to be awarded 1s governed
by Utah law. Mangold v. California Public Utilities Commission, 67 F. 3d. 1470 (9" Cir. 1995); and
Mitzel v. Westinghouse Electric Corporation, 72 F. 3d 414 (3" Cir. 1995).

In Campbell y. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, 65 P. 3d 1134 (Utah
2001), the Utah Supreme Court held that contingency fees should be used as the basis of a fee award
if it was reasonably foreseeable by the defendant that the plaintiff may employ an attorney on a
contingency fee basis. /d. at 1169-1170.' Plaintiffs in cases involving collection on notes and other
accounts receivable commonly engage legal counsel on a contingency fee basis. (Affidavit of David
M. Wahlquist, para. 8) The Davis Defendants should have reasonably foreseen that Steimke may
engage her counsel on a contingency fee basis in this matter. For these reasons, Steimke is entitled
to an award of $155,000 for her attorneys' fees.

The total judgment to which Steimke is entitled is $626,784.73 together with late fees/interest

at the rate of $1,000 per week from September 29, 2005 until paid in full.

 

' The United States Supreme Court ultimately reversed the Utah Supreme Court's ruling
in Campbell with respect to the amount of punitive damages awarded. The Utah Supreme
Court's ruling with respect to attorneys' fees was not affected and remains the law in the State of
Utah.
Case 2:03-cv-00487-DAK Document 59 Filed 08/17/05 Page 6 of 30

IL. THE COURT SHOULD EXPRESSLY DIRECT ENTRY OF JUDGMENT AS A
FINAL JODGMENT PURSUANT TO RULE 54(b).

Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides in part:

When one or more claim for relief is presented in an action . . . or when multiple
parties are involved, the court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or
more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination
that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of
judgment....

In its Order, the Court has completely adjudicated Steimke's Eighteenth Cause of Action
against the Davis Defendants. Having fully resolved one of Steimke's claims, the Court would be
justified in directing entry of judgment under Rule 54(b) on that basis alone. The propriety of
directing an entry of judgment is even more evident, however, because Steimke has stipulated that
she will dismiss the remainder of her claims against the Davis Defendants to become effective upon
the Court's Order with respect to her Eighteenth Cause of Action becoming final and non-
appealable. Such dismissal will likely negate the need for a trial in this matter, saving the resources
of the Court and the parties. There is no just reason for delay and the Court should expressly direct
the entry of judgment as final under Rule 54(b) in order to accrue this benefit.

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, Steimke requests the Court to direct entry of a final judgment

pursuant to Rule 54 (b) against the Davis Defendants jointly and severally on Steimke's Eighteenth

Cause of Action. Said judgment should be in the amount of $626,784.73, together with interest/late

fees in the amount of $1,000 per week after September 29, 2005 until paid in full.
