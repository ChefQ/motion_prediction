TO ALL PARTIES AND THEIR COUNSEL OF RECORD:
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that, on January 7, 2008 at 10:30 A.M., or as soon thereafter as

3

the matter may be heard, in the Courtroom of the Honorable Marilyn L. Huff of the United States

4

District Court, located at 880 Front Street, San Diego, California 92101-8900, defendants and

5

counterclaimants Dell Inc. (“Dell”), Microsoft Corporation, Gateway, Inc., Gateway Country

6

Stores, LLC, Gateway Companies, Inc., Gateway Manufacturing LLC and Cowabaunga

7

Enterprises, Inc. (collectively, “Defendants”) will move, and hereby do move, pursuant to this

8

Court’s inherent authority to control its own docket, see Landis v. North American Co., 299 U.S.

9

248, 254, 57 S. Ct. 163, 81 L. Ed. 153 (1936), for a stay of the trial in this action with respect to

10

U.S. Patent No. 4,958,226 (the “Haskell Patent”) and U.S. Patent No. 4,383,272 (the “Haskell

11

Patent”) pending a decision in the recent action brought by MPEG LA, L.L.C. (“MPEG LA”),

12

MPEG LA, L.L.C. v. Alcatel Lucent, Lucent Technologies, Inc. and Multimedia Patent Trust, in

13

Delaware Chancery Court seeking, inter alia, a declaration that Defendants and all other MPEG LA

14

MPEG-2 licensees are licensed under the Haskell and Netravali Patents pursuant to their license

15

agreements with MPEG LA (the “MPEG LA Action”). A finding by the Delaware Chancery Court

16

in MPEG LA’s favor would obviate a need for a trial in this action on the Haskell and Netravali

17

Patents, making a stay the most efficient way to proceed. Moreover, absent a stay, trial on the

18

Haskell and Netravali Patents will occur before MPEG LA’s claims are heard, and may result in the

19

imposition of billion dollar judgments against Defendants on patents covered by their MPEG LA

20

licenses.

21

In the alternative, in the event the Court declines to stay this action with respect to the

22

Haskell and Netravali Patents, Defendants will move, and hereby do move, pursuant to Rules 21

23

and 42 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for severance of the Haskell and Netravali Patents

24

from this action and consolidation of those patents for trial with the recent action brought by MPT

25

captioned Multimedia Patent Trust v. Microsoft Corporation, et al., Case No. 07-CV-0747 (the

26

“MPT Action”). Trying the Haskell and Netravali Patents along with the three patents asserted in

27

the MPT Action will streamline and render more efficient the upcoming trial in this action as well

28

as the trial in this action. The MPT Action alleges infringement of three additional video coding

patents assigned by Lucent to MPT. MPT’s infringement contentions with respect to those patents

2

concern many of the same products as MPT’s contentions with respect to the Haskell and Netravali

3

Patents, and trial of both sets of patents will involve some of the same witnesses. By contrast, the

4

Haskell and Netravali Patents have no overlap with the other patents to be tried in this action, which

5

involve very different areas of technology, products and witnesses. Moreover, consolidating the

6

Haskell and Netravali Patents together with the MPT Action will allow time for the Delaware court

7

to render a decision on MPEG LA’s license claims, which may obviate the need for any trial on the

8

Haskell and Netravali Patents. Finally, consolidation would eliminate the potential for a double

9

recovery by MPT on its video coding infringement claims. MPT’s damages theory for the Haskell

10

and Netravali Patents is based on a purported licensing practice by Lucent to license all of its

11

MPEG essential patents for 0.5% of the selling price of a computer, or a minimum of $1.50.

12

However, this purported practice included a license not only to the Haskell and Netravali Patents

13

but also the patents asserted in the MPT Action for a single royalty. Trying the patents separately

14

unfairly gives MPT the opportunity to recover its 0.5% royalty twice, when its own alleged

15

licensing policy calls for collection of only one royalty for all of the patents.

16

This motion is based on this Notice of Motion and Motion, the Memorandum of Points and

17

Authorities in support thereof, the declaration of James S. Blackburn filed concurrently herewith,

18

the pleadings, records and files in this action, and upon such other and further evidence and

19

argument as may properly be presented prior to and at the hearing on the Motion.
