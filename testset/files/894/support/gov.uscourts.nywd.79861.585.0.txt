MOTION TO INTERVENE BY JAMES CHARLES KOPP
UNDER FED. R. CIV P RULE 24(A), 24(B)

 

Comes Now, the movant James Charles Kopp, in pro-se, with newly discovered withheld
evidence moves this court to intervene under rule 24 as a unconditional matter of right.

STATEMENT OF FACT

 

Plaintiff Paul Ceglia was pen pals with me for the last 4 years. Ceglia told me in letters that

he was going to lie and create a fraud lawsuit against facebook so that he could use some

of the money to get me a paid top dollar attorney to help me with my appeal on my criminal
case.In particular Bruce Cutler who defended John Gotti. Also , me and Ceglia were ina
sexual relationship since.valentines day 2008_, but we broke up 2 2 days after Ceglia was arrested _
in october 2012 for fraud charges in relation to this case. Ceglia promised me $ 200 a month

in prison commissary for the rest of my prison life if he won this lawsuit. Also Ceglia promised
me a years subscription to mens health magazine and yoga journal if he won this fraud lawsuit
and told me he would fly down to prison in pennsylvania to visit me every sunday if he won.
After Ceglia got arrested I told him I want nothing to do with him because he was a scam artist
and I also found out Ceglia was cheating on me with a guy named Mario from Craigslist and

it mad me a emotional mess and sad. Now I have nightmares. Ceglia has been sending me
threatening letters telling me if I tell anyone about our sexual relationship he will kill me and
told me if I show anyone the 100"s of sexual letters he sent me he would break my fingers and
tell the family of Barnett Slepian where I'm at so both collectively try to sniper me or cause
bodily harm by paying inmates around me to put a shank in me which I'm very scared and I
have not left my cell since. I am a innocent man, I will testify that Paul Ceglia was the trigger
man and he shot Barnett Slepain, not me. I was framed by Ceglia, and I ask this court for a
new hearing on this matter. I demand my release asap, I support all abortions and I denounce
the lambs of christ, I'm a changed man , and i seek a second chance in life Movant
respectfully prays this court will grant his motion for relief.
