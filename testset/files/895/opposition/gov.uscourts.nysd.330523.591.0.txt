Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”), an interested non-party, respectfully submits this
memorandum of law in opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Reconsideration of the June
27, 2014 Order Granting Citibank, N.A.’s Motion for Clarification or Modification.
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
On June 27, 2014, this Court granted Citibank’s renewed motion for clarification of this
Court’s Amended February 23, 2012 Orders (the “Orders”), ruling that:
[T]his Court’s Amended February 23, 2012 Orders do not as a matter of law
prohibit payments by Citibank N.A’s Argentine branch on Peso- and U.S. Dollardenominated bonds—governed by Argentine law and payable in Argentina—that
were issued by the Republic of Argentina in 2005 and 2010 to customers for
whom it acts as custodian in Argentina.
Order, June 27, 2014 (Docket No. 547).1 Citibank had first sought clarification thirteen months
earlier, arguing (i) that the Orders did not, and should not, apply to the Argentine Law Bonds
because they, regardless of their currency, were materially different from the bonds the Court
had intended to make subject to the Orders, and (ii) Citibank’s position, given the presence of its
branch in Argentina, was materially different from that of other participants in the payment
process on Exchange Bonds. Citibank submitted a memorandum of law outlining the substantial
legal bases for Citibank’s position.2
Uniquely, Citibank also offered the unrebutted testimony of three experts who outlined
both the distinct structure and payment mechanism of the Argentine Law Bonds, and the severe
civil, regulatory and criminal risks faced by Citibank Argentina—an entity governed by the laws

Renewed Mem.”). Citibank incorporates by reference all of the papers filed in support of its original and renewed
motions.

Case 1:08-cv-06978-TPG Document 591 Filed 07/17/14 Page 4 of 9

of Argentina and subject to the regulations of the Central Bank of the Republic of Argentina—
and its employees and officers, should the Orders be applied to payments on the Argentine Law
Bonds.
Citibank renewed its motion on June 19, 2014, after the Supreme Court denied petitions
for certiorari in these cases. Plaintiffs did not refute Citibank’s evidence regarding either the
differences between the Argentine Law Bonds and the bonds addressed by the Orders, or the
severe consequences to which Citibank Argentina would be exposed if the Orders were not
clarified to exempt the Argentine Law Bonds.
Plaintiffs now argue, most disingenuously, that the Court did not understand Citibank’s
argument. They contend that the Court may have “overlooked” the fact that bonds denominated
in U.S. Dollars are External Indebtedness that may be covered by the pari passu clause, and that
“there were other statements made about the bonds generally during the hearing that Plaintiffs
believe may have resulted in the Court not appreciating the difference between the Pesodenominated Bonds and the U.S. Dollar-denominated Bonds – for example, statements that the
bonds have been ‘treated differently . . . all along,’ and that the Court ‘may have granted a
similar motion before.’” Mem. Law Supp. Pls.’ Mot. for Partial Reconsideration, July 10, 2014
(Docket No. 586) (“Pls. Mem.”) at 7–8.
Plainly, this Court well understood Citibank’s argument, based upon its briefs and
uncontradicted expert evidence, that the Argentine Law Bonds should not, as a matter of law, be
subject to the Orders, and were not, as a matter of fact, ever considered by the Court when
issuing the Orders. Plaintiffs have put forward no basis whatsoever for partial reconsideration
under Local Civil Rule 6.3, and their motion must be denied.

ARGUMENT
I.

THE STANDARDS FOR RECONSIDERATION ARE HIGH
Motions for reconsideration under Local Civil Rule 6.3 are “generally not favored and

[are] properly granted only upon a showing of exceptional circumstances.” Marrero Pichardo v.
Ashcroft, 374 F.3d 46, 55 (2d Cir. 2004) (citation omitted). “The standard for granting such a
motion is strict, and reconsideration will generally be denied unless the moving party can point
to controlling decisions or data that the court overlooked—matters, in other words, that might
reasonably be expected to alter the conclusion reached by the court.” Schrader v. CSX Transp.,
Inc. 70 F.3d 255, 257 (2d Cir. 1995). “[A] motion to reconsider should not be granted where the
moving party seeks solely to relitigate an issue already decided.” Id. Instead, motions for
reconsideration “should be granted only when the defendant identifies an intervening change of
law, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest
injustice.” Kobel Beth Yechiel of Tartikov, Inc. v. YLL Irrevocable Trust, 729 F.3d 99, 104 (2d
Cir. 2013).
II.

PLAINTIFFS OFFER NO BASIS FOR RECONSIDERATION
Plaintiffs do not suggest the existence of any intervening change of law, or any new

evidence, and there is none. They argue only that the Court was confused. The Court was not
confused, and Plaintiffs can show no clear error or manifest injustice.
Plaintiffs’ motion is premised upon the contention that, when the Court articulated its
“understanding that the bonds you’re talking about have been treated differently . . . all along,”
June 27, 2014 Hr’g Tr. at 26:23-27:1, the Court “misunderstood,” believing perhaps that it had
already issued an order differentiating these Argentine Law Bonds. Pls. Mem. at 8. No such
misunderstanding could have arisen from either the hearing or Citibank’s papers. Citibank never
argued that any prior order governed the Argentine Law Bonds, or that the Orders should exempt
3

Case 1:08-cv-06978-TPG Document 591 Filed 07/17/14 Page 6 of 9

the Argentine Law Bonds because the bonds denominated in U.S. Dollars were not External
Indebtedness, or were not covered by the pari passu clause. Instead, Citibank focused on the
unique characteristics of the Argentine Law Bonds, both Dollar- and Peso-denominated, arguing
that these bonds are materially different from the bonds described in this Court’s opinion
explaining the Orders—and different in a way that the Court has previously recognized as
material. See, e.g., Citi Renewed Mem. at 7 (“Whether denominated in U.S. Dollars or Pesos,
the Argentine Law Bonds were both issued pursuant to Argentine decrees, not the Indenture, and
both are subject to Argentine law and payable in Argentina.”).
In its opinion issued in connection with the Orders, this Court described in detail the
payments that were to be enjoined:
The process and the parties involved in making payments on the Exchange Bonds
are as follows. Argentina transfers funds to the Bank of New York Mellon
(“BNY”), which is the indenture trustee in a Trust Indenture of 2005. Presumably
there is a similar indenture for the 2010 exchange offer. BNY then forwards the
funds to the “registered owner” of the Exchange Bonds. There are two registered
owners for the 2005 and 2010 Exchange Bonds. One is Cede & Co. and the other
is the Bank of New York Depositary (“BNY Depositary”). Cede and BNY
Depositary transfer the funds to a “clearing system” such as the Depository Trust
Company (“DTC”). The funds are then deposited into financial institutions,
apparently banks, which then transfer the funds to their customers who are the
beneficial interest holders of the bonds.
NML Capital, Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina, No. 08 Civ. 6978 (TPG), 2012 WL 5895786, at *5
(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 21, 2012).
Citibank argued that the Court could not have intended to include the Argentine Law
Bonds in the scope of the Orders because they are entirely different from those described in this
opinion. The Argentine Law Bonds were issued under Argentine decrees, not the Indenture
governing the other Exchange Bonds; payment to Citibank Argentina is made solely in
Argentina through local entities, not through BNY in the United States; no U.S. depository is

4

Case 1:08-cv-06978-TPG Document 591 Filed 07/17/14 Page 7 of 9

involved; and the bonds do not provide for any submission to U.S. jurisdiction. See Citi
Renewed Mem. at 3-6. The Court certainly understood these critical distinctions when
remarking that “to grant your motion does not affect the other bonds of concern at all.” June 27,
2014 Hr’g Tr. at 27:4-5.
Citibank had also made substantial arguments that, a matter of law, the Amended
February 23, 2012 Orders could not and should not be applied to the Argentine Law Bonds:
Were the [Amended February 23, 2012] Orders to restrain payments in Argentina
on the Argentine Law Bonds, the [Amended February 23, 2012] Orders would be
inconsistent with this Court’s prior rulings that restraints may not be imposed on
payments of funds, not owned by the Republic of Argentina (the “Republic”), that
are to be made entirely in Argentina. Further, because the situs of these payments
is Argentina for act of state purposes, any such interpretation of the [Amended
February 23, 2012] Orders would also contravene the act of state doctrine, as
authoritatively construed by the Second Circuit en banc in Allied Bank
International v. Banco Credito Agricola de Cartago, 757 F.2d 516 (2d Cir. 1985).
Finally, by exposing Citibank Argentina to grave regulatory, civil and possible
criminal risk for obeying a court order not recognized as valid in Argentina, a
construction of the injunctions that would prevent legally mandated payments
with an Argentine situs would impose an extreme and inequitable burden upon
Citibank Argentina well beyond the “minor and ancillary” relief permitted in
equity jurisprudence against a non-party. Gen. Bldg.Contractors Ass’n v. Penn,
458 U.S. 375, 399–402 (1982); Alemite Mfg. Corp. v. Staff, 42 F.2d 832, 832–33
(2d Cir. 1930).
Citi Renewed Mem. at 2-3.
In its brief, Citibank made extensive reference to two decisions of this Court that were
relevant to its legal argument. See Citi Renewed Mem. at 8-13 (discussing EM Ltd. v. Republic
of Argentina (“EM Ltd.”), 865 F. Supp. 2d 415 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) and Aurelius Capital Partners,
LP v. Republic of Argentina (“ANSES”), No. 07 Civ. 2715, 2010 WL 768874 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 5,
2010)). Both decisions described in detail the funds that were the subject of those opinions, and
both decisions held that, as in this case, no restraint was appropriate as a matter of law. See id.

5

Case 1:08-cv-06978-TPG Document 591 Filed 07/17/14 Page 8 of 9

It was to these decisions that counsel for Citibank understood the Court was referring when it
remarked that it “may have granted a similar motion before.” June 27, 2014 Hr’g Tr. at 27:4.
Finally, Citibank Argentina put before the Court material evidence that is entirely
uncontradicted. Federico Elewaut testified that under Argentine law it would be illegal not to
distribute payments on the Argentine Law Bonds to customers. See Decl. of Federico Elewaut
Supp. Citibank’s Mot. for Clarification, May 22, 2013 (Docket No. 461). Manuel Beccar Varela
testified that non-payment would subject Citibank Argentina, and its personnel, to criminal
sanctions in Argentina. See Decl. of Manuel Beccar Varela Supp. Citibank’s Mot. for
Clarification, May 22, 2013 (Docket No. 462). Maximiliano D’Auro testified that foreign court
orders would not be recognized as a defense by Argentine courts. See Decl. of Maximiliano
D’Auro Supp. Citibank’s Mot. for Clarification, May 22, 2013 (Docket No. 463).
None of this testimony was refuted by Plaintiffs. The declarations present compelling
evidentiary support for Citibank’s arguments that the Amended February 23, 2012 Orders should
not apply to the Argentine Law Bonds under the act of state doctrine and the doctrine of foreign
sovereign compulsion because Citibank Argentina and its personnel were at material risk. See
Citi Renewed Mem. at 17–20.
Plaintiffs ignore all of this. Their motion is premised solely upon the contention that the
Argentine Law Bonds were described at the hearing as “internal Argentine bonds,” and their
speculation that, as a result, the Court was mistaken as to whether the U.S. Dollar-denominated
bonds were Exchange Bonds covered by the Court’s Amended February 23, 2012 Orders. See
Pls. Mem. at 7 (quoting June 27, 2014 Hr’g Tr. at 26:5–6). The record, including the papers
before the Court, makes plain that there is no support for any such conjecture. The Court well
understood Citibank’s arguments, which were consistent with prior rulings of this Court.

CONCLUSION
Plaintiffs have made no showing of any basis for reconsideration under Local Civil Rule
