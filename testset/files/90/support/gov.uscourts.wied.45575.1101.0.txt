GREEN BAY DIVISION

APPLETON PAPERS INC. and
NCR CORPORATION,
Plaintiffs,
v.

No. 08-CV-16-WCG

GEORGE A. WHITING PAPER COMPANY, et al.,
Defendants.

PLAINTIFF APPLETON PAPERS INC.’S MOTION TO RECONSIDER
THE COURT’S CONCLUSION THAT API’S LIABILITY UNDER
CERCLA IS UNCONTESTED
Plaintiff Appleton Papers Inc. (“API”) by its undersigned counsel,
respectfully moves the Court pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Fed. R. Civ. P. and
Eastern District Civil Local Rule 7, for reconsideration of the Court’s conclusion
in its March 1 Decision and Order that API’s liability under CERCLA is
uncontested (Dkt. 1080, p. 14).
API respectfully submits that the Court overlooked API’s position, because
API has consistently denied that it has liability under CERCLA. Moreover, API
contested its liability when Defendants filed motions for summary judgment on
their counterclaims. The grounds for this motion are set forth in detail in the
Memorandum Of Plaintiff Appleton Papers Inc. In Support Of Motion To
Reconsider The Court’s Conclusion That API’s Liability Under CERCLA Is
Uncontested, which is being contemporaneously filed on this date.
