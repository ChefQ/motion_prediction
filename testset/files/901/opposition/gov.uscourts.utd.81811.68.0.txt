Receiver and to Bar WBGI Payments.
POINT I

PLAINTIFF WAGNER LACKS STANDING TO BRING A MOTION
TO APPOINT A RECEIVER FOR WBGI.

Plaintiff Wagner has brought a Motion for Appointment of Cal Andrus as Receiver and to
Bar WBGI Payments ("Motion"). (Docket # 59) Plaintiff lacks standing to bring the Motion. On
March 5, 2012, Magistrate Warner issued a Report and Recommendation in which Magistrate
Warner dismissed Plaintiff's fraud, waste and mismanagement claims. (Docket # 30) Magistrate
Warner stated in relevant part:

It appears that Wagner no longer has any stake or any ownership interest in

WBGL According to the Second Hawaii Decision, his shares were sold and he

was lawfully removed from WBGI. As such, the court agrees with WBGI's

argument that Wagner lacks standing to bring his fraud, waste and

mismanagement claim and, therefore, that the claim should be dismissed for lack

of subject matter jurisdiction.

(Docket # 30, pg. 18)

Plaintiff's Motion raises similar issues to those already raised in the fraud, waste and
mismanagement section of Plaintiff's Complaint. Plaintiff complains of "extensive wrongdoing,
including criminal fraud, tortious conduct, etc."(Docket # 59, pg. 6) However, this Court has
found that it does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such claims.

"Under NRS 78.650, a shareholder may request dissolution or appointment of a receiver

when the corporation's directors are guilty of fraud or collusion or gross mismanagement . . . ."

Bedore v. Familian, 125 P.3d 1168, 1171 (Nev. 2006)(internal quotations omitted)(emphasis -
added). Plaintiff is no longer a shareholder and simply lacks standing to bring a shareholder
action for the appointment of a receiver under Nevada law. Accordingly, Plaintiffs Motion
should be denied.
POINT II
DEFENDANT WBGI DOES NOT OWE PLAINTIFF MONEY.

Plaintiff claims that "plaintiff is owed money by defendant WBGI, as now affirmed by

the Hawaii appellate court... ." (Docket # 59, pg. 9) This is not true. In Wagner v. World

Botanical Gardens, Inc., 268 P.3d 443, 456 (Haw. Ct. App. 2011) the Court held that:

 

genuine issues of material fact exist as to: the services Wagner provided to WBGI
that would be a basis for his quantum meruit claim; whether he was required to be
licensed under HRS Chapter 444 to provide such services; and whether such
services that he rendered would be barred from recovery under HRS 0x00A7 444-22,

The court went on to rule that:

Wagner's quantum meruit claim extends over numerous years and, although there
is a multitude of evidence suggesting questionable conduct by Wagner, we are
unable to agree with the circuit court that summary judgment is warranted on this
claim based on a factual finding of unclean hands. . . . [W]e conclude that there
are genuine issues of material fact on the question of unclean hands pertaining to
Wagner's quantum meruit claim.

Id. at 456, .

As is apparent from the above quotes, the Hawaii Court of Appeals did not find WBGI

owed Plaintiff any money. Instead, the court noted that there were questions of fact both on

3 WGI 03
Case 2:11-cv-00784-CW-PMW Document 68 Filed 07/10/12 Page 4 of 6

 

 

Wagner's quantum meruit claim as well as WBGI's equitable defense of unclean hands. There
has been no determination by the Hawaii courts that WBGI owes Plaintiff any money.
POINT Wi
THERE IS NO BASIS FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A RECEIVER,

The Nevada Supreme Court recognizes that "the appointment of a receiver or the
dissolution of a corporation is a harsh and extreme remedy which should be used sparingly and
only when the securing of ultimate justice requires it." Bedore v, Familian, 125 P.3d 1168, 1172
(Nev. 2006)(internal quotations omitted). Plaintiff seeks the appointment of a receiver based on
allegations of fraud, waste and abuse in his Amended Complaint and affidavits. Ironically, much
of the financial difficulty experienced by WBGI is a result of Plaintiffs ongoing litigation
against WBGI.

In contrast to Plaintiff's allegations, are the following findings by the Nevada State Court
that has had the opportunity to review and assess Plaintiff's claims:

"The dispute over control of WBGI has been nothing more than a relentless conspiracy and
campaign by Defendant Walter Wagner and other remaining Defendants to gain control of WBGI

at any cost."
(Docket # 7, Exhibit A, Nevada Decision, pg. 4, J 13).

"At every opportunity, Defendant Walter Wagner has attempted to paralyze and destroy WBGI -
he has frozen the WBGI bank account; he has improperly and illegally recorded a lis pendens
against the property of WBGI and its Garden Director, Dr. Lanny Neel; he has trespassed on
WBGI property, where he sprayed weed-killer on garden plants; he has taken over and/or closed
WBGI's website, thereby destroying WBGI's internet marketing plan; and he improperly sold
interests in WBGI and pocketed the proceeds, thereby depriving WBGI of badly needed capital

Case 2:11-cv-00784-CW-PMW Document 68 Filed 07/10/12 Page 5 of 6

and defrauding investors."
(Docket #7, Exhibit A, Nevada Decision, pgs. 6 - 7, 23).

Plaintiff's Motion lacks factual support. Mr. Wagner's history, reflected in the now final
Nevada Decision, undercuts any claimed concern Mr. Wagner expresses for WBGI. According to
the Nevada Court, Mr. Wagner has attempted to destroy WBGI. This is remarkably strong
language. Mr. Wagner's. Motion should be denied as lacking a sufficient factual basis.

CONCLUSION

Because this Court has already found Plaintiff lacks standing on the same issues
encompassed within Plaintiff's Motion, this Court should deny Plaintiff's Motion. This Motion is
the latest episode in Plaintiff's ongoing abuse of process. The purpose, intent and unfortunately
the effect of which is to force WBGI to incur ever mounting legal fees and costs. Defendants
respectfully request that the Court summarily deny Plaintiff's Motion.

DATED this Dhiny of July, 2012.
