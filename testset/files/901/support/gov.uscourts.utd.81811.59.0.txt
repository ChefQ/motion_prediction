MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF CAL ANDRUS AS RECEIVER
AND TO BAR WBGI PAYMENTS

Plaintiff Walter L. Wagner respectfully moves this Court to appoint Mr.
Cal Andrus as a Receiver of the WBG I corporation assets and liabilities for
the purpose of salvaging WBGI from the gross mismanagement it has been
experiencing, and to bar WBGI from making any further payments to
attorneys or law firms until it has satisfied the outstanding appellate
decision rendered against it by the Intermediate Court of Appeals in Hawaii
earlier this year.
This motion is based upon the First Amended Complaint filed herein,
upon the earlier filed affidavits in support of prior motions, upon the
accompanying SWORN AFFIDA VIT OF WALTER L

WAGNER IN

SUPPORT OF ANDRUS' APPOINTMENT AS RECEIVER, upon the
accompanying

SWORN AFFIDA VIT OF CAL VIN N.

ANDRUS IN

SUPPORT OF APPOINTMENT AS RECEIVER, upon the Memorandum of
Law in Support of AppOintment of Cal Andrus as Receiver to be filed
herein, and upon such other and further affidavits and documents as may
be filed in support thereof and on such oral argument as may be presented
herein.

This motion is necessitated based upon two salient facts as detailed
in the accompanying affidavits and memorandum of law:
1)

WBGI spent approximately $700,000 on lawyers (with most going to

a college crony of defendant Michie) in its attack upon the WBGI founder,
plaintiff herein, for the purpose of avoiding the liability to the plaintiff herein
for his construction work in building the botanical garden. Nevertheless,
WBGI has been found liable to him by the Hawaii appellate court, which is
in an amount similar to the amount spent by defendants trying to unlawfully
avoid that liability; and
2)

Lead members of the current management team of WBGI, who are

defendants herein, have engaged in extensive wrongdoing, including
criminal

fraud,

tortious conduct,

etc.

directed towards the WBGI

shareholders and plaintiff, and that wrongdoing has caused the WBGI
shareholders extensive harm. These include, but are not limited to:
a)

Inducing dozens of WBGI shareholders to deposit their money

into a dedicated "Visitor Center Account" on the false written promise that
their additional investment money would be used exclusively for
construction of a much-needed and much-anticipated Visitor Center, but

3

Case 2:11-cv-00784-CW-PMW Document 59 Filed 06/26/12 Page 4 of 6

instead spending the money on fraudulent litigations and payments to
defendant Michie's college crony, and then thereafter lying about it and
falsely claiming that plaintiff herein had illegally spent those monies
elsewhere;
b)

Lying to WBGI shareholders by defendant Francik falsely

proclaiming that plaintiff herein was "caught" by his girlfriend defendant
Cobos during an "audit" in an alleged 'embezzlement' when in fact he was
entirely set up and induced into selling his own shares to help meet WBGI's
payment obligation on credit card loans, and then falsely charged with
selling company treasury shares, not his own;
c)

Lying to WBGI shareholders and others by defendant Francik

falsely proclaiming that plaintiff herein and his wife were not WBGI officers
when they signed the last in a series of nine promissory notes written to
save WBGI from having to make financial outlays and deferring that
obligation for a period of ten years, falsely asserting instead that such
signatures constituted 'attempted theft' and 'identity theft' and initiating
fraudulent criminal charges thereon and falsely publishing those false
charges to the WBGI shareholders long after they were dismissed by the
courts;
4

Case 2:11-cv-00784-CW-PMW Document 59 Filed 06/26/12 Page 5 of 6

d)

Selling off of WBGI's primary assets, its land holdings, and

leaving WBGI with less than 10% of its original holdings; selling off of
WBGI's land assets in violation of WBGI By-Laws and established practice;
selling off of WBGI's land assets to personal friends of some of the named
defendants herein without realtor assistance or public offering but rather by
'private placement' at prices greatly below market value;
e)

Billing WBGI approximately $150,000 by defendant Michie for

alleged 'legal work' in assisting his college crony in promoting the frauds of
defendant Francik;
f)

Neglecting of the botanical garden infrastructure, including

allowing extensive growth of weeds and loss of plantings, and failing to
maintain the development program instituted by the founder.
As a consequence of those facts, the WBGI shareholders, including
plaintiff herein, have been seriously harmed and will continue to be further
harmed unless this Court appoints a Receiver to manage the affairs of
WBGI in a manner consistent with prudent business practices. Because of
the extensive experience with Mr. Cal Andrus, both as a US Military officer

"

'

and in the private sector, as well as with the formation of WBGI, it is
strongly encouraged to this Court to appoint Mr. Andrus as that Receiver.
Because WBGI owes plaintiff herein monies, as determined by the
appellate court of Hawaii as a final decision, it is requested that this Court
further bar any payments by WBGI to others until WBGI has satisfied that
obligation, or as otherwise directed by the WBGI Receiver.
DATED: June 22,2012
