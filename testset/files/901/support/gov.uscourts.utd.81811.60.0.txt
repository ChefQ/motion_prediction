MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF APPOINTMENT
F AND AS RECEIVER

INTRODUCTION

The law is clear that appointment of a Receiver is warranted under
certain circumstances such as herein. A Receiver can be appointed when
a case is filed in federal Bankruptcy Court for dissolution or reorganization,
and a Receiver can also be appointed pursuant to the applicable state

statutes pertaining to corporations.

This Court obtained jurisdiction over this matter that would otherwise
be before a state court, due to the diversity jurisdiction. Title 28 of the

United States Code, 0x00A7 1332, reads in pertinent part:

(a) The district courts shail have original jurisdiction of all
civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the
sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs,
and is between -

(1) citizens of different States

In this matter plaintiff is a citizen of Utah, WBGI is incorporated in

2
Case 2:11-cv-00784-CW-PMW Document 60 Filed 06/28/12 Page 3 of 11

Nevada with its principal place of business in Hawaii, and the other named
defendants are citizens of various states other than Utah, Nevada or
Hawaii, providing complete diversity jurisdiction.

The applicable state law pertaining to corporations is the Nevada
Revised Statutes (NRS), though similar laws exist in all 50 states pertaining

to corporations incorporated in those other states.
`The applicable Nevada Revised Statute reads

NRS 78.650 Stockholders' application for injunction and
appointment of receiver when corporation mismanaged.

1. Any holder or holders of one-tenth of the issued and
outstanding stock may apply to the district court in the county
in which the corporation has its principal place of business or, if
the principal place of business is not located in this State,
to the district court in the county in which the
corporation's registered office is located, for an order
dissolving the corporation and appointing a receiver to wind up
its affairs, and by injunction restrain the corporation from
exercising any of its powers or doing business whatsoever,
except by and through a receiver appointed by the court,
whenever:

(a) The corporation has willfully violated its charter:

(b) Its trustees or directors have been guilty of fraud or
collusion or gross mismanagement in the conduct or
control of its affairs;

(c) Its trustees or directors have been guilty of
misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance;

(d) The corporation is unable to conduct the business or
conserve its assets by reason of the act, neglect or refusal to
function of any of the directors or trustees;

(e) The assets of the corporation are in danger of waste,

3
Case 2:11-cv-00784-CW-PMW Document 60 Filed 06/28/12 Page 4 of 11

sacrifice or loss through attachment, foreclosure, litigation
or otherwise;

(f) The corporation has abandoned its business;

(g) The corporation has not proceeded diligently to wind up
its affairs, or to distribute its assets in a reasonable time;

(h) The corporation has become insolvent:

(i) The corporation, although not insolvent, is for any
cause not able to pay its debts or other obligations as they
mature; or

(j) The corporation is not about to resume its business with
safety to the public.

2. The application may be for the appointment of a
receiver, without at the same time applying for the
dissolution of the corporation, and notwithstanding the
absence, if any there be, of any action or other proceeding in
the premises pending in such court.

3. In any such application for a receivership, it is sufficient
for a temporary appointment if notice of the same is given to the
corporation alone, by process as in the case of an application
for a temporary restraining order or injunction, and the hearing
thereon may be had after 5 days' notice unless the court directs
a longer or different notice and different parties.

4. The court may, if good cause exists therefor, appoint
one or more receivers for such purpose, but in all cases
directors or trustees who have been guilty of no negligence nor
active breach of duty must be preferred in making the
appointment. The court may at any time for sufficient cause
make a decree terminating the receivership, or dissolving the
corporation and terminating its existence, or both, as may be
proper.

5. Receivers so appointed have, among the usual powers,
all the functions, powers, tenure and duties to be exercised
under the direction of the court as are conferred on receivers

and as provided in NRS 78.635, 78.640 and 78.645, whether
the corporation is insolvent or not.

Nevada law is clear that enforcement of its statutory law can be had
in jurisdictions other than Nevada, even without relying on federal diversity
jurisdiction. The NRS 78.650, paragraph 1, specifically allows for
enforcement proceedings in any other state, and by application of federal
diversity jurisdiction, it becomes enforceable before this Court. This is to
ensure that sound business practices are followed and not encumbered by
requirements necessitating appearances in Nevada. The Nevada
Secretary of State has sought to augment that state's coffers by making
Nevada a State in which it is easy to file articles of incorporation (and
annual filing fees) for companies not actually located in Nevada (as have
Delaware and Wyoming become preferred states for filing articles of

incorporation to augment their state's coffers).
Two salient facts can be applied to the above Nevada statute:

1) WBGI spent approximately $700,000 on lawyers (with most going to
a college crony of defendant Michie) in its attack upon the WBGI founder,

plaintiff herein, for the purpose of avoiding the liability to the plaintiff herein
Case 2:11-cv-00784-CW-PMW Document 60 Filed 06/28/12 Page 6 of 11

for his construction work in building the botanical garden. Nevertheless,
WBGI has been found liable to him by the Hawaii appellate court, which is
in an amount similar to the amount spent by defendants trying to unlawfully

avoid that liability; and

2) Lead members of the current management team of WBGI, who are
defendants herein, have engaged in extensive wrongdoing, including
criminal fraud, tortious conduct, etc. directed towards the WBGI
shareholders and plaintiff, and that wrongdoing has caused the WBGI

shareholders extensive harm. These include, but are not limited to:

a) Inducing dozens of WBGI shareholders to deposit their money
into a dedicated "Visitor Center Account" on the false written promise that
their additional investment money would be used exclusively for
construction of a much-needed and much-anticipated Visitor Center, but
instead spending the money on fraudulent litigations and payments to
defendant Michie's college crony, and then thereafter lying about it and

falsely claiming that plaintiff herein had illegally spent those monies

elsewhere;
Case 2:11-cv-00784-CW-PMW Document 60 Filed 06/28/12 Page 7 of 11

b) Lying to WBGI shareholders by defendant Francik falsely
proclaiming that plaintiff herein was "caught" by his girlfriend defendant
Cobos during an "audit" in an alleged `embezzlement' when in fact he was
entirely set up and induced into selling his own shares to help meet WBGI's
payment obligation on credit card loans, and then falsely charged with

selling company treasury shares, not his own;

c) Lying to WBGI shareholders and others by defendant Francik
falsely proclaiming that plaintiff herein and his wife were not WBGI officers
on January 1, 2004 when they signed the last in a series of nine promissory
notes written to save WBGI from having to make financial outlays and
deferring that obligation for a period of ten years, falsely asserting instead
that such signatures constituted `attempted theft' and `identity theft' and
initiating fraudulent criminal charges thereon and falsely publishing those
false charges to the WBGI shareholders long after they were dismissed by

the courts;

d) Selling off of WBGI's primary assets, its land holdings, and
leaving WBGI with less than 10% of its original holdings; selling off of
WBGI''s land assets in violation of WBGI By-Laws and established practice:

selling off of WBGI's land assets to personal friends of some of the named

7
Case 2:11-cv-00784-CW-PMW Document 60 Filed 06/28/12 Page 8 of 11

defendants herein without realtor assistance or public offering but rather by

`private placement' at prices greatly below market value;

e) Billing WBGI approximately $150,000 by defendant Michie for
alleged `legal work' in assisting his college crony in promoting the frauds of

defendant Francik;

f) Neglecting of the botanical garden infrastructure, including
allowing extensive growth of weeds and loss of plantings, and failing to

maintain the development program instituted by the founder.

When plaintiff originally incorporated WBGI he controlled 33.33333%
of the shares. Over time he was `watered-down' by issuance of additional
shares, and his ownership was reduced to 16.66667%, and now at about
13% with his sale of some of his shares. While defendants proclaim that
they sold-off his shares to `satisfy' a judgment obtained by fraud in Nevada
(the fraudulent claim that plaintiff sold WBGI treasury shares and pocketed
the money, when in reality he sold some of his own shares, and donated
most of the money to WBGI), that fraud does not serve to preclude plaintiff
from bringing this instant action for appointment of a Receiver, in that that

fraud is part of the fraud and collusion complained of against defendants.
Case 2:11-cv-00784-CW-PMW Document 60 Filed 06/28/12 Page 9 of 11

Moreover, plaintiff is owed money by defendant WBGI, as now
affirmed by the Hawaii appellate court; just the exact opposite of what the
defendants herein were telling the Nevada judge, i.e. their fraudulent claim
that he was not owed any money for building the botanical garden and he
simply `donated' ten years of his time to its construction. That amount
owed to plaintiff by WBGI far exceeds the amount of the `judgment'
fraudulently obtained in Nevada, and there was never a valid legal basis to
sell plaintiff's share ownership in WBGI, and it remains at about 13% (less
than 16,66667% because he sold a few of his shares). That share
ownership qualifies plaintiff to seek a Receiver under the NRS provision

(first paragraph of NRS 78.650) requiring a 10% ownership interest in

seeking a Receiver.

The defendants have violated six (6) of the ten (10) provisions of NRS-
78.650, namely a-e and i of paragraph 1. Violation of any one of those
provisions is sufficient cause to appoint a Receiver. Violation of all six
simply shows this Court that defendants are unfit to continue serving in any

capacity on behalf of WBGI.

Not only is WBGI unable to pay its debt to plaintiff herein, it continues

to encumber itself in litigation, while using various frauds to either provoke

9
Case 2:11-cv-00784-CW-PMW Document 60 Filed 06/28/12 Page 10 of 11

suits, or defend suits, as has been amply detailed in numerous sworn

affidavits previously filed herein.

While one can only speculate as to the motive behind the actions of
the defendants, the motive of greed comes readily to mind. `It could only be
greed that would have compelled defendant Michie to bill WBGI
approximately $150,000 to promote the various frauds delineated by
defendant Francik. However, the motives are irrelevant to the violation of
those sections - the simple fact that so many of the NRS 78.650 provisions
`have been violated is all that is required to show the necessity for the
immediate appointment of Mr. Cal Andrus as the Receiver of the remaining
WBGI assets, which will also serve to settle the instant complaint, as well

as the judgment obtained by plaintiff against WBGI for his services

rendered.
lil

CONCLUSION

While the instant tort claims would give any prudent business person
cause to wonder what's wrong with the `management' of WBGI, they are

but a small fraction of the numerous other wrongs engaged by that
