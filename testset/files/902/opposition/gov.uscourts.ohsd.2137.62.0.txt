v. : PLAINTIFFS' RESPONSE
> MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF
THE INTERNATIONAL PAPER : INCLUSION OF VACATION PAY AS

(Exhibit attached)

MEMORANDUM IN RESPONSE

 

Defendant has provided no justification for excluding Plaintiffs' claim for vacation pay,
or for precluding a supplemental notice to the class to determine the damages figure for the final
judgment entry. Instead, Defendant indicates in its Brief that it has already obtained verification
of each employee's accrued vacation time as of F ebruary 9, 2001 from each employee as part of
their exit process; ' therefore, supplemental notice may not be necessary if Defendant is ordered
to produce those documents and figures, which it has refused to do in objecting to Plaintiffs'
discovery requests directed to that information."

Vacation pay should be included in the damages calculation in the final judgment entry.
First, Defendant is not permitted by ERISA to "discharge its obligation" by trying to pass the
vacation pay to Smart Papers. Second, Defendant's arguments based on common and state law

theories of contract are precluded by ERISA preemption principles and are without merit even if

considered. Third, Defendant's obligation was not fulfilled by Smart Papers. Fourth, there has

been no waiver of any argument or entitlement to Section 7.1's vacation pay in this case.

1. Defendant May Not Discharge its Obligation Via Smart Papers

Defendant boldly claims in its opening that "IP's obligation to pay `earned but unused
vacation' has already been discharged." In so stating, Defendant acknowledges that it had this
obligation, created by Policy #828, thereby affirming Plaintiffs and this Court's conclusion that
Plaintiffs were terminated and are entitled to Policy #828 benefits. Defendant then underscores
that conclusion in its responses to Plaintiffs' Interrogatories by stating that the former employees
who were not offered employment by Smart Papers' "were paid lump sum monetary payments
for earned but unused vacation time pursuant to Reorganization Severance Policy #828."

The issue in this case, which has already been briefed and decided, is whether Defendant
should pay benefits pursuant to its Plan. This action is based upon Section 502(a)(1)(B) of
ERISA, 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1132(a)(1)(B), which provides plan beneficiaries with a cause of action to
enforce their rights under the terms of the plan. Defendant is in agreement: it has argued at
every stage of this case - from moving for a stay, to resisting discovery, to seeking judgment -
that the issue is plan interpretation. And Section 7.1 of Policy #828 unambiguously states that

Defendant will make a lump sum payment to a terminated employee for accrued vacation time.0x00B0

The Plan clearly imposes upon Defendant the obligation is to make a lump sum
payment.' Defendant admits that "[e]mployees not hired by Smart Papers received their earned
but unused IP vacation in a lump sum", but that the Plaintiffs were paid nothing by IP, and never
received a lump sum payment.(R) Defendant explains that the way that it "paid" Plaintiffs was
not pursuant to the terms of its own Plan, but that: "Vacation was paid as it was taken during
their employment with Smart Papers in lieu of a lump sum payment by IP." Therefore,
contrary to Defendant's protestations, Plaintiffs are not seeking to impose any "duty to pay these

vacation amounts a second time"!(R)

or for "additional" '' or "double!" payments because, as
Defendant admits in its brief, "IP's vacation was not paid in a lump sum' ever.

It is not within Defendant's province to (once again) depart from its own Plan and
unilaterally determine how it can avoid the monetary payment it expressly promised to make by
assigning or selling or transferring that severance policy obligation to one (but not all)
subsequent employer(s).'4

Defendant cannot escape its obligation under Policy #828 merely by giving "express
written notice to class members"'* that it has tried to do so. There is no language in the Plan that
informs the employees that any benefit thereunder may or will be delegated to a subsequent

employer. Rather, Policy #828 clearly informs the employees that they will receive a lump sum

payment for their accrued vacation, by IP, if they are terminated before June 20, 2001.

It is irrelevant that "IP clearly advised IP employees in writing that if they accepted an
offer from Smart Papers, they would be paid their earned but unused vacation"!(R) because the
employees HAD NO CHOICE -- they were also told that if they did NOT accept an offered job
from Smart Papers, they would receive NO Policy #828 benefits.'' Further, Smart Papers was
never going to make any lump sum payment to the Plaintiffs for accrued vacation time and
Defendant has offered no evidence that the obligation to make any monetary lump sum payment
was assumed by Smart Papers. Rather, the employees were told, "any unused vacation you had
with IP can be taken as vacation with Smart Papers.""(R)

As discussed in Plaintiffs' Motion (Doc. #59), the benefits under Severance Policy #828,
an employee welfare plan within the meaning of the statute, vested on February 9, 2001 pursuant
to the Plan's express terms. The court can easily ascertain the parties' intent by looking to the
written terms of the Plan which control the determination of whether the benefits are vested.'(R)
The Court has already considered the evidence and the arguments on this point, and has
concluded that Policy #828 is unambiguous in guaranteeing certain welfare benefits, including
the monetary payment for earned vacation, and that Plaintiffs' entitlement to those benefits

vested upon their termination on February 9, 2001 since their termination occurred within the

one year period that the benefits were guaranteed."0x00B0

ERISA was enacted "to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in
employee benefits plans and to protect contractually defined benefits.?! "[P]arties may
themselves set out by agreement or private design, as set out in the plan documents, whether
retiree welfare benefits vest or whether they may be terminated."** This serves the important
purpose of "insuring against the possibility that the employee's expectations of the benefit would
be defeated by an unanticipated amendment of a welfare plan..."'> Here, Defendant expressly
stated in Policy #828 that the benefits "shall not be terminated" and "no amendment will be
effective if it would adversely affect the rights, expectancies, or benefits" of Plaintiffs within the
one year window of time between June 20, 2001 and June 20, 2002.74

The Plan informed the employees that, if they were terminated in a precise window of
time and no longer worked for International Paper, they would get certain lump sum monetary
payments in hand. Those Policy #828 benefits are and always have been the damages in this
case. Had Defendant fulfilled its obligations under Policy #828, the employees would have been
able to make their own decisions about working for Smart Papers, working for another company
locally or elsewhere, or retiring from employment all together - decisions Policy #828 told them
they would be able to make if they were terminated by International Paper before June 20, 2001.

in written benefits plans and are held to promises they make in their [Summary Plan

intelligent decisions about their future benefits needs.""0x00B0 In making decisions about where and

does, however, seek to ensure that employees will not be left emptyhanded once employers have

guaranteed them certain benefits.""*

2. Defendant's Contract Arguments are Preempted and Without Merit

Defendant argues several contractual theories (third party beneficiary, delegation,
assumption, substitution, novation) to support its evasion of the clear language in its own Plan,
citing several sections of the Restatement of Contracts and Ohio Jurisprudence. First, these
arguments are preempted by the federal statute and do not, therefore, warrant consideration.
Second, these arguments are factually flawed and without merit even if considered. And third,
Defendant cites only two inapplicable cases and provides no other case in which vacation pay
was a specified benefit in a severance plan which guaranteed a lump sum payment upon
termination; the unique facts of this case and this Plan control and make irrelevant the cases
relied upon by Defendant.

a. ERISA Preempts State Law Claims

ERISA subjects to federal regulation plans providing employees with fringe benefits and
is a comprehensive statute designed to promote the interests of employees in employee benefit

exclusive federal concern, Congress passed 0x00A7 514(a) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C 0x00A71144(a), known as
the "preemption provision" which reads:

Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the provisions of this
subchapter and subchapter III of this chapter shall supersede any and all State
laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan
described in section 1003(a) of this title and not exempt under section 1003(b) of
this title.

The Supreme Court has specifically found that in passing 0x00A7 514(a) it was Congress' intent:

To ensure that plans and plan sponsors would be subject to a uniform body of
benefits law; the goal was to minimize the administrative and financial burden of
complying with conflicting directives among States or between States and the
Federal Government . . . [and to prevent] the potential for conflict in substantive
law . . . requiring the tailoring of plans and employer conduct to the peculiarities
of the law of each jurisdiction."

The Act does not, however, specify whether every policy to provide vacation benefits
falls within its ambit.*' The Supreme Court has explained that the distinguishing feature is that

employee welfare benefit plans included within the scope of ERISA are those which are

"payable only upon the occurrence of a contingency outside the control of the employee." "

Thus, for example, plans to pay employees severance benefits, which are payable
only upon termination of employment, are employee benefits plans within the
meaning of the Act. ... The reference to vacation payments [in the Act] should be
understood to include within the scope of ERISA those vacation benefits funds,
analogous to other welfare benefits, in which either the employee's right to a
benefit is contingent upon some future occurrence or the employee bears a risk
different from his ordinary employment risk.*

The Sixth Circuit has recently explained that it looks to the nature of the plan, whether

the plan requires an administrative program, what degree of discretion the employer retains over

distribution of the benefits, and whether the employer must "analyze each employee's particular
circumstances in light of the appropriate criteria" to determine benefits."**

Here, Plaintiffs are making their claims pursuant to Severance Policy #828 which was
operative only upon the occurrence of a contingency - termination within the one year period of
the policy - which was certainly outside the control of Plaintiffs. Further, the record is replete
with the administrative requirements imposed upon Plaintiffs and this Court,*0x00B0 the repeated claim
that Defendant retained all discretion to determine eligibility,*0x00B0 and the Plan Administrator filed
an affidavit explaining his role of analyzing each employee's eligibility for benefits.*"

Although federal courts apply "general rules" of contract law as part of the federal
common law, state law is not controlling authority.0x00B0(R) The parties to an ERISA plan may define
the terms and conditions under which benefits are made available," and the application of these
terms and conditions is controlled by federal and not state law.*" In this case, Defendant decided
to include vacation benefits in its severance plan and, as an employee welfare plan under ERISA,
itis controlled by federal law.

b. Defendant's Contract Arguments are Factually Flawed

Defendant's contract arguments fail even if they are considered because they are all

based on the same faulty premises: that Plaintiffs chose or agreed or consented or freely

accepted the novation or substitution or delegation or assumption by Smart Papers; and that
Plaintiffs received payment for their vacation. Had Plaintiffs been given the opportunity to
receive their Policy #828 lump sum payment from Defendant OR take a job with Smart Papers
(and transfer their vacation time to that new employer), there could be an argument that Plaintiffs
"accepted" "agreed" or "consented" to the latter. However, Plaintiffs were told that they would
be denied Policy #828 benefits if they were offered a job by Smart Papers, so the choice was not
theirs to make. No acceptance, consent or agreement can be engrafted onto these facts to provide
the critical bases necessary to impose these contractual principles on Plaintiffs.

Defendant makes an entirely new and unsupported assertion in its brief: that the
employees had a choice and could have turned down a Smart Papers job and gotten a lump sum
payout of all unused vacation.*! However, not only is the record void of any evidence to support
this contention, Defendant's own brief and the record actually contradicts it:

" Defendant, on page 5 of its brief, cites to Q&A's which appeared in a Mill

newsletter dated January 22, 2001 where IP told the Plaintiffs only that: "If
hired by Smart Papers, any unused vacation you had with IP can be taken as
vacation with Smart Papers.'** The employees are never told they may take a

lump sum payment.

" Defendant's an e-mail dated just after midnight on February 9, 2001, the day
the employees were terminated, attached Q&A's which told the Plaintiffs:

1) that they were "not entitled to benefits under Severance Policy
828" if they did not accept a job offered by Smart Papers at the
same base salary; and

2) that they were "not entitled to benefits under Severance Policy
828" if they did accept an offer from Smart Papers."

" IP's vacation policy and interrogatory answers only state that the employees
are entitled to their vacation, not any pay for that unused vacation."* In
contrast, Policy #828 states that they are entitled to receive a lump sum
payment for that unused vacation time.

There is no evidence to support Defendant's contention, on page 13 of its brief, that
Plaintiffs had a choice and could have turned down a Smart Papers job and gotten a lump sum
payout of all earned but unused vacation. Thus, Plaintiffs never made a choice because they
were never given a choice. Plaintiffs could not have agreed or consented or freely accepted the
"contractual" terms now espoused by Defendant.

c. Headrick and Armstrong are Neither Controlling or Persuasive

Defendant cites only two inapplicable cases and provides no other case in which vacation
pay was a specified benefit in a severance plan which guaranteed a lump sum payment upon
termination. The unique facts of this case and this Plan control and make irrelevant the cases
_ relied upon by Defendant.

The Headrick "case cited by Defendant is a Tenth Circuit decision in which the
severance plan, unlike Policy #828, contained specific language providing severance pay upon
the satisfaction of certain conditions which were not met; thus, the plaintiffs in Headrick, unlike
the Dalesandro Plaintiffs, were not entitled to any benefits under their plan. More importantly,
the claim for vacation pay in Headrick was not made pursuant to any provision for the same in
the severance plan, but was based upon the Colorado Wage Claim Act; therefore, the court's

analysis of the claim for vacation pay under contract principles was not conducted in the context

of an ERISA claim as we have in the case at bar. Accordingly, Defendant's reliance on
