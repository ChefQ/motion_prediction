Judge Sandra S. Beckwith

PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR
SUPPLEMENTAL NOTICE
and
MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF
INCLUSION OF VACATION PAY AS
DAMAGES________________________
(Exhibits attached)

MOTION
Plaintiffs’ move the Court for an order authorizing the Supplemental Notice attached
hereto (Exhibit 1) to be sent to the class members to inform them of the calculation of each
member’s accrued vacation pay as of February 9, 2001; and for an order directing Defendant to
provide such calculations for each class member to be attached to the Supplemental Notice.
MEMORANDUM
I.

BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs filed this ERISA action for the recovery of benefits under Champion

International Corporation Reorganization Severance Policy #828. On March 21, 2003, the Court
entered its Amended Order granting Plaintiffs’ motions for judgment and for class certification
(Doc. #40). The parties then worked toward determining the damages figure, and they briefed
their disputes over attorneys’ fees, costs, interest, and incentive awards, so that the final
judgment entry could be specific and complete. The latter issues have been fully briefed and

submitted to the Court; the damages calculation is the subject of this Motion and Memorandum.
Plaintiffs are attempting to obtain the calculations of each employee’s accrued vacation time to
include as damages pursuant to Section 7.1 of Policy #828; Defendant has refused to provide
those calculations contending that Plaintiffs’ claims for vacation benefits are not a part of this
lawsuit, and that they received their vacation pay from their subsequent employer.
By Court Ordered Notice dated September 24, 2003 (Doc. # 50), the approximate 150
members of the Class were informed that this action had been certified, that the Court had
rendered its opinion on the merits, and that they had certain rights and obligations related to their
participation or exclusion from the action. This Notice also included Defendant’s calculation of
each employee’s severance benefits (provided by Section 2 of Policy #828), and Pension
Enhancement (provided by Section 3 of the Policy), but did not include any calculation of the
employees’ earned but unused vacation pay (provided by Section 7.1 of Policy #828).
This Notice instructed the class members to review the calculation attached to their
Notice and to send a letter within 30 days to Defendant (Sharon Barger is the contact person
provided by International Paper) if they believed the calculation was incorrect, and it directed the
objecting employee to explain why the calculation was incorrect. More than 70 employees sent
letters to Defendant within the required time objecting to the calculations based on the omission
of their earned but unused vacation time that they had accrued while under Defendant’s employ.1
The Notice also stated that International Paper Company would respond to those objections
setting forth a reviewed determination and explanation of the calculation no later than 20 days
after the receipt of any such letter.
Only days after the Court’s Notice was mailed, Plaintiffs’ counsel began receiving phone
calls with questions about the omission of their accrued vacation time; Plaintiffs counsel also

received multiple calls from class members who have not received the promised response from
International Paper within the 20 day period stated in the Notice.2

Upon receiving copies of

those letters and phone calls from class members, Plaintiffs contacted Defendant in early October
to alert it to the problem and to inquire as to how Defendant had responded or intended to
respond to those letters.3

Plaintiffs suggested that the parties work toward an agreed

supplemental notice wherein Defendant would provide the employees its calculation of the
amount of earned and unused vacation time each employee had accrued as of their termination
on February 9, 2001, in a similar fashion as Defendant provided the calculation of each
employee’s years of service and pension enhancement.4
The parties were unable to reach agreement and the Court granted Defendant’s request to
conduct discovery and ordered the simultaneous filing of briefs (Doc. #55). The parties served
expedited discovery requests related to the vacation pay issue upon each other, and Defendant
obtained documents from Plaintiffs’ present employer, Smart Papers, LLC.
II.

ARGUMENT
This case is about Severance Policy #828. Policy #828 includes a section entitled

Miscellaneous Benefits which includes a provision that Defendant will make a lump sum
payment to a terminated employee for accrued vacation time.5
“ [T] he issue at hand is one of plan interpretation, not the legality of any actions taken or
not taken by IP.”6 This is a direct quote from Defendant and has always been its view of this
case. Defendant has always argued that the resolution of all issues turned on the language of

Severance Policy #828 and the reasonableness of its interpretation. Now, for the same reasons,
and based upon the simple language of the same Plan, it is clear that vacation pay is a benefit
under Policy #828. Since Defendant made no monetary payment to Plaintiffs for their accrued
vacation, the amount of this benefit should be included in the damages calculation.
This is merely a damages issue since the Court has already ruled and set forth the factual
and legal reasoning as to why Plaintiffs are entitled to Severance Policy #828 benefits.
Defendant admits it denied vacation pay for the same reasons it denied the other Policy #828
benefits.7 Plaintiffs are entitled to vacation pay for the same reasons as the Court found them to
be entitled to Section 2 severance benefits because both categories of benefits are part of the
same severance policy which promised that employees would receive the benefits contained
therein if they were terminated without cause within the one year guaranteed time period.8 No
further analysis is necessary.
The Plan is clear:
An Eligible Employee will receive a lump sum payment for banked vacation,
earned but unused vacation and, if eligible to retire (under provisions of Section 3
or otherwise), accrued vacation.9
This is not a case where the employees are trying to incorporate some separate document
or language or vacation plan into the severance plan – vacation pay is a part of Severance Policy

The Court has found that: the plan administrator failed to adhere to, and in fact ignored, the plain meaning of the
Plan’s unambiguous language; the plan administrator’s interpretation of the Plan was arbitrary and capricious; the
plan administrator read out of the Plan’s clear provisions that made the payment of benefits contingent upon
“termination” as that term is defined in the Plan and instead made payment contingent upon his own
interpretation; International Paper’s position that employees who received subsequent employment with the
purchaser of the Mill were ineligible for severance benefits was unsupported by any language in the Plan; and
International Paper could have included a specific provision to that effect as it had in an earlier severance plan.

#828. This is not a case where the employees are trying to characterize vacation pay as a benefit
– vacation pay is specifically listed as a “miscellaneous benefit”.
Plaintiffs, like Defendant, have interchangeably referred to the benefits sought in this
case as “severance benefits”, “benefits under the Plan”, “benefits under Policy #828”, and
“Policy #828 benefits.” But Plaintiffs never, expressly or impliedly, confined the benefits sought
to those set forth in only Section 2 of the Plan; nor did they waive their right to the benefits
provided for in Section 7 of the Plan merely because that section does not have the title
“Severance” in its heading. Nor has Defendant ever indicated that its repeated use of the phrase
“benefits under the Plan” was restricted to only certain portions of the Plan.
From the beginning and throughout this case, Defendant has maintained that the
discovery and use of evidence outside of the Plan and the Administrative Record are unnecessary
and inappropriate.10 If proof, beyond the Plan itself, that vacation pay is a benefit that has
always been a part of this case is needed, the Court need only review the record. Defendant’s
argument that this claim has not been properly raised is contrary to logic, to its own Plan, to its
own pleadings, and to the record:
1) The Plan itself

Severance Policy #828 is Defendant’s plan. Defendant drafted this

Plan; Defendant decided to offer this Plan to the employees at the Hamilton B Street Mill when it
merged with Champion; Defendant chose to apply this Plan when it sold the mill to Smart
Papers. Policy #828 is a severance plan. All benefits provided therein are arguably “severance

benefits” for the reason that they are benefits to be provided a terminated employee. This
severance plan provides for different types of benefits, among which is vacation pay.
2) Defendant’s Questions & Answers.12 Defendant published and distributed information
explaining Policy #828 to Plaintiffs in the form of Questions and Answers. This is a six-page
document, which deals only with Policy #828, and which includes vacation pay in its description
of the benefits that would be paid upon termination. Defendant reiterated Section 7.1 of the Plan
and informed the employees they would receive a lump sum payment for their earned but unused
vacation time.
3) Plaintiffs’ claim letters13 From the very first time they made their claims, as early as
February 16, 2001 and within a week of their termination, Plaintiffs included and specified that
they were seeking payments for their earned vacation pursuant to Section 7.1 of the Policy.
4) Defendant’s Answer14 Defendant repeatedly referred to the benefits at issue as
“benefits under the Plan” and did not restrict its view or the case to any one provision, category,
section or type of benefit in the Plan.
5) Other employees’ claim letters15 Nearly one hundred other employees included
vacation pay specifically in their claim letters.
6) March 2001 Determination of Administrator16 The Plan Administrator referred to all
“benefits under Policy #828” and recognized vacation pay as one of those benefits as early as
March 2001. His determination was made “with respect to Policy 828 as it applies to the sale of
the Mill” and was not confined to any certain provision, section or type of benefit in the Plan.

7) May 2001 decision letters from Plan Administrator to Plaintiffs17 The Plan
Administrator again referred to all “benefits under Policy #828” and explained specifically why
the Plaintiffs’ claims for the vacation pay benefit was denied.
8) October 2001 Warner Memorandum18 The Plan Administrator, Robert Florio, and the
International Paper employee who decided the appeals of Florio’s decision, Paul Karre, both
consulted with counsel about this case and Plaintiffs’ claims; both were both advised by Charles
Warner of Porter Wright Morris & Arthur.19 Mr. Warner wrote a memo to both Florio and Karre
containing multiple references to vacation pay as a benefit under Policy #828 and how to deal
with all of claims for vacation pay. Further, Defendant has acknowledged that the Plan
Administrator considered the individual “facts concerning the employment of each claimant,”20
so the many claims for vacation pay were reviewed and considered by both Florio and Karre.
9) December 2001 decision letter from Karre to Plaintiffs 21 When Karre informed
Plaintiffs that he affirmed Florio’s denial of benefits, he referred to all “benefits under Policy
828” and devoted one entire paragraph to the explanation of the denial of Plaintiffs’ claims for
the vacation pay benefit.

10) November & December decision letters from Karre to other employees22 Similarly,
Karre explained in detail his affirmance of the denial of the vacation pay benefit in letters to over
70 other employees who had made claims for vacation pay.
11) Defendant’s Motion for Judgment23

Defendant acknowledged that the parties’

dispute involves all of the “benefits under Policy #828”, repeatedly using that phrase, including
the vacation pay benefit. In its Memorandum in Support of its Motion for Judgment, Defendant
set out the various categories of benefits at issue:
D. The Severance Policy Provides Benefits to Terminated Employees
The Policy provides a series of benefits to assist employees terminated
from their employment, including:
1. Severance Benefits …
2. Pension Enhancement …
3. COBRA …
4. Vacation Pay … 24
12) Defendant’s discovery requests25 Defendant admitted as recently as two weeks ago
in its objections and responses to Plaintiffs’ discovery requests related to vacation pay that:
Vacation pay is a Policy #828 benefit:
[F]ormer salaried employees of International Paper who were not offered
employment by Smart Papers, or who were offered employment at a reduced
salary and rejected such offer, were paid lump sum monetary payments for
earned but unused vacation time pursuant to Reorganization Severance Policy
#828.26
***
And that vacation pay was considered by the Defendant and the Administrator in this
case.27

And that all documents that relate to vacation pay “are already in the possession of
Plaintiffs” – Defendant then lists all the evidence and pleadings already in this case
where vacation pay has been addressed.28

There should be no dispute that the vacation pay benefit has been properly raised and
presented in this case.
As to Defendant’s contention that Plaintiffs received this benefit from Smart Papers, all
those same arguments were made by Defendant in the context of contesting the award of other
Policy #828 benefits, and were rejected by the Court. Nowhere in Policy #828 does it make
eligibility for any benefit contingent upon anything that any subsequent employer – whether that
be Smart Papers or any other employer – gives or does not give to the former International Paper
employees. Severance Policy #828 was drafted by Defendant, could have and did not contain
such language, and instead clearly gives several benefits upon severance if the employees were
terminated before June 20, 2001. Plaintiffs were terminated on February 9, 2001. No further
analysis is necessary. It is irrelevant that Defendant tried to pass its obligation to pay monetary
sums for the vacation its terminated employees had accrued to those employees’ new employer.
Second, paying these employees the vacation time they accrued with International Paper
in the time preceding their termination on February 9, 2001 does not result in a windfall or
double recovery because the employees worked the entire year of 2001 for Smart Papers without
earning any vacation; Smart Papers changed the vacation policy effective January 1, 2002 so that
they earned no vacation time in 2001:
When a company’s ownership changes (and in our case, an entirely new company
is formed) changes in policy generally result. One such change is the Vacation
Policy for Salaried Employees.29

Under the SMART Papers policy, effective January 1, 2002, vacation time for
salaried employees accrues on an ongoing basis during the year in which the
vacation is was taken. Under the former owners [International Paper] vacation
time accrued during the prior year.30
***
As a salaried SMART Papers employee, you will begin accruing vacation for
2002 as of your first day of work in January 2002.If you were formerly employed
by Champion or IP, any vacation time you have taken or will take during 2001
was earned during 2000 as an employee of one or both of those companies.31
***
Under the Asset Purchase Agreement SMART Papers was created as a new
business this past February. No vacation time for salaried employees accrued
during 2001. Vacation eligibility for all salaried employees begins in calendar
year 2002.32
Thus, Plaintiffs did not get paid for the vacation time they had accrued prior to February
9, 2001: Defendant did not pay Plaintiffs a monetary sum as was required by Policy #828; Smart
Papers did not pay any monetary sum to Plaintiffs. Smart Papers only gave the employees the
time off that they had earned in the previous year, but did not give them any credit for the time
they worked in 2001 toward any paid vacation time in 2002. The employees may have received
paid vacation in 2001 while at Smart Papers, but they did so at the expense of working for more
than ten and one half months without earning any vacation time; Plaintiffs started over at zero on
January 1, 2002.

Therefore, the employees would not enjoy an unfair windfall or double

recovery if they receive a their monetary sum for the vacation they had earned prior to February
9, 2001 pursuant to Policy #828.
In a similar case, the Sixth Circuit explained that the crediting of vacation time by a
subsequent employer did not discharge the former employer’s obligation to pay the employees

for the work they had performed prior to their termination.33 The Adams Court explained that
the vacation benefits had vested according to the plan and that a recovery of those benefits
against the former employer did not result in a double recovery or windfall.34
Moreover, Plaintiffs accrued vacation time was not Defendant’s to give or sell or transfer
to ANY subsequent employer in lieu of making a monetary payment to the employees. Plaintiffs
should have been given the choice whether to take all the benefits available pursuant to Policy
#828, including a monetary payment for their earned unused vacation, and to work for whomever
they chose, or for no one. If Plaintiffs had taken a job with any employer other than Smart
Papers (which they should and would have been able to do if Defendant honored its obligations
under Policy #828), immediately after being terminated, Defendant would have denied them
their Policy #828 benefits (for the reason that they would have refused the job with Smart
Papers). However, Defendant could not and would not have transferred its ERISA obligation to
pay a benefit under it Plan to all other subsequent employers35, just as it should not have tried to
pass that obligation to Smart Papers.
The Plan told the employees that, if they were terminated and no longer worked for
International Paper, they would get certain lump sum monetary payments in hand.

Had

Defendant fulfilled its obligations under Policy #828, the employees would have been able to
make their own decisions about working for Smart Papers, working for another company locally
or elsewhere, or retiring from employment all together – decisions Policy #828 told them they
would be able to make if they were terminated by International Paper before June 20, 2001. The

would provide to Plaintiffs (Exh. 15 at Interrogatory No. 6).

Sixth Circuit has explained that employers must fulfill the obligations they undertake in written
benefits plans:
[E]mployees count on them to provide an accurate picture of their current benefits
situation, as well as for information which will allow them to make intelligent
decisions about their future benefits needs. . . .In this circuit, under Edwards [v.
State Farm, 851 F.2d 134 (6th Cir. 1988)], companies are held to the promises
they make in their [Summary Plan Descriptions].”36
***
When making decisions about where and how long to work, employees, like the
plaintiffs in this case, rely on the promises made to them, particularly when those
promises are in writing.37
Plaintiffs reasonably read the guaranteed provision of specified benefits in Policy #828 to
mean that they would receive those benefits if they were terminated before June 20, 2001. Rather
than fulfill those promises, Defendant ignored Policy #828 and now urges the Court to reward it
for transferring its obligation to another company. Again, if Defendant had intended to retain
that right, it could and should have drafted and included language to that effect in the Plan to
inform the employees of that contingency. Absent any such language, Plaintiffs are entitled to a
lump sum payment for vacation time they earned and did not use as of their termination on
February 9, 2001. Defendant cannot contract away its obligation under ERISA and its own
severance plan through any sales agreement or otherwise. If Defendant believes that it is unfair
for it to pay the vacation benefits, it has only itself to blame, or it can seek recourse from Smart
Papers rather than making Plaintiffs pay the price of their earned vacation.
ERISA subjects to federal regulation plans providing employees with fringe benefits and
is a comprehensive statute designed to promote the interests of employees in employee benefit

plans.38 The statue specifically states that the term “employee welfare benefit plan” means “any
plan, fund, or program . . . established or maintained by an employer . . . for the purpose of
providing for its participants . . . vacation benefits.”39 And, although a vesting requirement does
not exist under ERISA for a welfare benefits plan (as compared to a pension benefits plan),
employers may vest welfare benefits if they choose to do so.40 To determine whether welfare
benefits have vested, the court ascertains the parties’ intent and looks to the written terms of the
plan documents which control.41 “The language of the plan’s ‘written instrument’ determines
whether the benefits are vested.”42

In this case, as the Court has already found, Policy #828 is

unambiguous and sets forth and guarantees certain welfare benefits, including the monetary
payment for earned vacation, and that they would vest upon termination if that termination
occurred before June 20, 2001.
ERISA does not require employers to establish employee benefits plans, nor does it
mandate what types of benefits employers must provide if they choose to offer a benefits plan.
But, as the United States Supreme Court has explained, “ERISA does, however, seek to ensure
that employees will not be left emptyhanded once employers have guaranteed them certain
benefits.”43

Based upon the foregoing, Plaintiffs respectfully move the Court to: 1) Order Defendant
