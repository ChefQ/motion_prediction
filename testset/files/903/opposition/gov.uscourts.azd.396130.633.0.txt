The United States, through undersigned counsel, opposes Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss.
Defendant asks this Court to dismiss the charges, arguing that the government’s failure to
preserve data collected from the aircard tracking operation is a due process violation. As argued
below, Defendant fails to show that the data would be helpful, he fails to explain why other
evidence – such as e-mails or reports regarding the tracking operation or testimony from case
agents involved in the investigation – would be insufficient, and he fails to show that the United
States acted in bad faith by complying with an Order from a U.S. Magistrate Judge.1

Defendant erroneously contends that the government sought to conceal the use of the
equipment used to locate the subject aircard in order to insulate itself from later challenges from its use.
There is no evidence of such intent, subjective or objective, in the record, or evidence that the subject

The failure to preserve exculpatory evidence can violate a defendant’s due process rights,

2

but the evidence must “possess an exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was

3

destroyed, and be of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable

4

evidence by other reasonably available means.” California v. Trombetta, 467 U.S. 479, 489

5

(1984). If the evidence is only potentially useful, a defendant must show that the government

6

acted in bad faith. Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51, 58 (1988).

7

In Trombetta, defendants charged with drunk driving moved to suppress the Intoxilyzer

8

results showing their blood-alcohol level at the time of arrest, arguing that the government

9

violated due process by failing to preserve the actual breath samples those results were based on.

10

See 467 U.S. at 482-483. The Supreme Court found no due process violation, explaining that

11

“chances are extremely low that preserved samples would have been exculpatory.” Id. at 489.

12

The Court also found that the defendants had other means to challenge the results, including

13

through cross-examination of the law enforcement officer who administered the Intoxilyzer test.

14

Id. at 490. See also, Phillips v. Woodford, 267 F.3d 966 (9th Cir. 2001) (Defendant failed to

15

show that destruction of murder victim's car was in bad faith.); Cooper v. Calderon, 255 F.3d

16

1104 (9th Cir. 2001) (Police destruction of bloody overalls turned in by a witness did not violate

17

due process right of a defendant charged with murder.)

18

Here, there was, and presently is, no reason to think that the raw data collected during the

19

aircard tracking operation would be exculpatory. If called to testify, FBI agents familiar with

20

the aircard tracking operation will confirm that, in this case, the pen register and trap and trace

21

equipment did not locate the aircard within a particular apartment. Defendant speculates that

22

the FBI should have been able to locate the aircard with greater precision, but the facts are that

23

(...continued)
destruction was carried out with any knowledge that the destroyed data would in any manner be
exculpatory. What is clearly obvious from the record is that the government has sought from day 1 to
minimize the use of the subject equipment in order to avoid being required to disclose privileged
information regarding the sensitive law enforcement nature of the equipment. (See Def’t Mem. 7-9.)

they did not and that they took numerous additional investigative steps, e.g., analysis of the lease

2

application and utility accounts, surveillance and a ruse takeout food delivery, in order to verify

3

the location of the aircard. There is absolutely no basis to conclude that the raw data collected

4

during the operation would show otherwise. Moreover, Defendant has been provided with e-

5

mails, reports, and other material related to the tracking operation, and, if he requests an

6

evidentiary hearing, he will have an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses who are familiar

7

with the tracking operation, e.g., the FBI case agent. He fails to explain why this is insufficient

8

to satisfy due process. Indeed, unlike the Intoxilyzer results at issue in Trombetta, the precision

9

of the aircard tracking operation or the related equipment will not be an issue at trial and has

10

nothing to do with whether Defendant committed the charged crimes.

11

Defendant claims that “[t]he destroyed evidence would unquestionably show that the

12

aircard was located precisely inside [his apartment],” and he speculates that government agents

13

convinced the U.S. Magistrate Judge to order destruction of the data because the agents knew

14

in advance that the data would be helpful to Defendant. (Def’t Mem. 1, 8.) This is pure

15

speculation and lacks any basis in fact. The government acted in good faith by following the

16

U.S. Magistrate Judge’s Order and was not aware of any potential exculpatory value of the

17

expunged materials. Even if the order had not required destruction of the data, the FBI has a

18

standard policy of destroying the real-time data at the end of a tracking operation. If called to

19

testify, the FBI case agent familiar with the operation will confirm this.

20

Accordingly, Defendant’s motion should be denied.
