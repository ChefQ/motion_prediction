MOTION TO DISMISS FOR

Defendant.

Defendant, Daniel David Rigmaiden, appearing pro se, respectfully submits this

17 Motion To Dismiss For Destruction Of Evidence. Through this motion, the defendant
18 respectfully requests that the Court dismiss the case with prejudice if it finds that (1) the
19 defendant had a lesser expectation of privacy within apartment No. 1122 and in the aircard
20 location if the destroyed real-time aircard location data indicated that the aircard was located
21 to an area covering three or four apartments, (2) the defendant had a greater expectation of
22 privacy within apartment No. 1122 and in the aircard location if the destroyed real-time
23 aircard location data indicated that the aircard was located precisely inside apartment No.
24 1122, and (3) the defendant is unable to prove that the aircard was located precisely inside
25 apartment No. 1122 with the evidence he has already placed on the record (all the evidence
26 he currently has regarding the matter). As an alternative to dismissal, the defendant
27 respectfully requests that the Court make a factual finding that the aircard was located
28 precisely inside apartment No. 1122 for the purposes of deciding all Fourth Amendment

1 issues. The defendant is filing this motion considering his Fifth and Fourth Amendment
2 rights were violated due to the government's bad faith destruction of the real-time aircard
3 location data obtained via the N.D.Cal. 08-90330MISC-RS order and obtained via the
4 StingRay. The destroyed evidence would unquestionably prove that the aircard was located
5 precisely inside apartment No. 1122. The defendant respectfully requests that the Court
6 immediately rule on this motion so that, at the very least, it will be settled from this point
7 forward whether the defendant's Motion To Suppress should be framed in light of the
8 destroyed evidence indicating that the aircard was located precisely inside apartment No.
9 1122 or to an area covering three or four apartments. If this motion is not immediately

10 decided then the defendant will be prejudiced considering he will be forced to have his
11 Motion To Suppress address the government's concocted three or four apartment scenario of
12 which is contrary to the truth. This motion is supported by the memorandum of points and
13 authorities attached hereto and incorporated by this reference.
14

This motion and all attachments were drafted and prepared by the pro se defendant,

15 however, he authorizes his shadow counsel, Philip Seplow, to file this motion and all
16 attachments on his behalf using the ECF system. The defendant is appearing pro se and has
17 never attended law school. The defendant's filings, however inartfully pleaded, must be
18 liberally construed and held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by
19 lawyers. See Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972).
20

LRCrim 12.2(a) requires that the undersigned include the following statement in all

21 motions: “Excludable delay under 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(1)(D) will occur as a result of this
22 motion or of an order based thereon.”
