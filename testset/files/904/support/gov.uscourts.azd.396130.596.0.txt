Defendant, Daniel David Rigmaiden, appearing pro se, respectfully submits this

17 Motion/Application For Subpoena Duces Tecum Pursuant To Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c) For
18 Prometheus Real Estate Group. Through this motion, the defendant respectfully requests
19 that the Court order the attached subpoena and order to be issued and served on Prometheus
20 Real Estate Group's statutory agent at the government's expense pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P.
21 17(b) and (c), and 28 USC § 1825(a), et seq. The subpoena and order are needed in order to
22 obtain items of an evidentiary value and to ensure that fees and costs are paid associated with
23 the subpoena. Prometheus Real Estate Group is the parent company that has
24 authority/ownership[1] over the property upon which the Domicilio apartment complex is
25 built. In support of this application, the defendant sets forth arguments in Section II, infra.

ARGUMENT
The evidence sought to be subpoenaed from Prometheus Real
Estate Group has an evidentiary value.

Attached to this motion is the defendant's subpoena seeking production of blueprints

11 for a section of the Domicilio apartment complex, 431 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA, and
12 limited apartment rental/occupancy records. The subpoenaed items have an evidentiary
13 value going to the defendant's Fourth Amendment arguments relating to the government's
14 aircard locating mission. The subpoenaed items are not in the possession of the government,
15 are not otherwise procurable by the defendant through exercise of due diligence, are needed
16 by the defendant in order to prepare his Motion To Suppress, and are admissible at a
17 suppression hearing. The defendant meets the requirements to have the attached subpoena
18 issued.
19

While determining what was “evidentiary” in the context of a subpoena, the Supreme

20 Court in United States v. Nixon adopted the four-part test set forth by Judge Weinfeld in
21 United States v. Iozia, 13 F.R.D. 335, 338 (S.D.N.Y. 1952). See id., 418 U.S. 683, 699
22 (1974). “Under this test, in order to require production prior to trial, the moving party must
23 show: (1) that the documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise
24 procurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the party
25 cannot properly prepare for trial without such production and inspection in advance of trial
26 and that the failure to obtain such inspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial; and
27 (4) that the application is made in good faith and is not intended as a general 'fishing
28 expedition.'” Id. at 699-700. The right of an indigent criminal defendant to use subpoenas
-2-

Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document 596 Filed 08/17/11 Page 3 of 7

1 also rests on “the Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process and on the Fifth
2 Amendment right not to be subjected to disabilities by the criminal justice system because of
3 financial status.” United States v. Sims, 637 F.2d 625, 629 (9th Cir. 1980).
4

The evidence the defendant seeks from Prometheus Real Estate Group has an

5 evidentiary value as explained in the subsection that follows. The defendant will not repeat
6 any relevant threshold Fourth Amendment arguments considering they are already articulated
7 in his Motion For Discovery. The following subsections will only show how the evidence
8 sought to be subpoenaed will establish facts that will substantiate the defendant's claims

MOTION/APPLICATION FOR SUBPOENA DUCES TECUM PURSUANT TO
FED. R. CRIM. P. 17(c) FOR PROMETHEUS REAL ESTATE GROUP
CR08-814-PHX-DGC

9 contained in his Motion For Discovery and thus provide a basis for his Fourth Amendment
10 arguments. The defendant respectfully requests the Court look to his Motion For Discovery
11 for the relevant Fourth Amendment arguments or set a hearing where the defendant can
12 explain to the Court verbally how the evidence sought to be subpoenaed supports his Fourth
13 Amendment arguments and possibly address other questions regarding the other Nixon
14 factors. The defendant has requested oral arguments so that he may elaborate on his need for
15 the subpoenaed evidence in the event that the Court finds this motion deficient. With respect
16 to subpoenaed item No. 1, it should be noted that the defendant has made repeated requests
17 (for over a year) to both his court-appointed legal researcher and court-appointed private
18 investigator to obtain the requested blueprints. Members of the defendant's court-appointed
19 defense either refuse to obtain the blueprints based on it costing too much money to pay up
20 front (investigator) or give up on trying to obtain the blueprints when the task becomes too
21 complex to complete from within Arizona (legal researcher/Seplow assistant). The
22 defendant has no other option to obtain the needed blueprints.

1. Prometheus Real Estate Group Subpoena, Item No. 1.
The defendant is requesting blueprints for the Domicilio apartment complex for the

25 two buildings containing relevant apartments. The defendant needs the requested evidence
26 so that he can determine X, Y, and Z axis measurement values for the precision and margin of
27 errors claimed by the government with respect to using the StingRay, etc., to locate the
28 aircard inside apartment No. 1122. By analyzing the requested blueprints, the defendant will
-3-

Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document 596 Filed 08/17/11 Page 4 of 7

1 be able to determine precise measurements in support of the facts and arguments discussed in
2 his Motion For Discovery, Section V(E), and VI(C)(1)(a) and (2)(a).

2. Prometheus Real Estate Group Subpoena, Item No. 2.
The defendant is requesting details regarding which apartment units were rented out

5 of all of the relevant apartments between June 1, 2008 and August 4, 2008. The defendant
6 needs the requested evidence so that he can determine which apartments near apartment No.
7 1122 were unoccupied/occupied at the time the government located the aircard. Living in an
8 apartment with less immediate neighbors is more private than living in an apartment with

MOTION/APPLICATION FOR SUBPOENA DUCES TECUM PURSUANT TO
FED. R. CRIM. P. 17(c) FOR PROMETHEUS REAL ESTATE GROUP
CR08-814-PHX-DGC

9 more immediate neighbors. Additionally, an empty apartment would have allowed the
10 government to immediately infer that the empty apartment does not contain the aircard and
11 thus increase the real world precision of its aircard locating mission even under the
12 government's concocted three or four apartment precision claim.

The defendant is indigent and cannot afford to pay for service of the
attached subpoena or fees of Prometheus Real Estate Group.

The defendant is indigent with currently $0.03 in liquid assets. Attached to this

16 motion/application is a declaration by the defendant attesting to his indigent status. The
17 defendant respectfully requests that the Court issue an order requiring (1) the government to
18 pay for service of the subpoena and order, and (2) that Prometheus Real Estate Group be paid
19 in the same manner in which similar costs and fees are paid in the case of a witness
20 subpoenaed on behalf of the government.

III.

CONCLUSION

For the reasons stated above, the defendant respectfully requests that the Court (1)

24 grant this motion and issue the attached subpoena, (2) issue the attached order requiring that
25 the costs incurred by the process and the fees of Prometheus Real Estate Group so
26 subpoenaed shall be paid in the same manner in which similar costs and fees are paid in the
27 case of a witness subpoenaed on behalf of the government, and (3) if needed, set a hearing
28 where the defendant can further elaborate on how the requested evidence is relevant and

This motion and all attachments were drafted and prepared by the pro se defendant,

3 however, he authorizes his shadow counsel, Philip Seplow, to file this motion and all
4 attachments on his behalf using the ECF system. The defendant is appearing pro se and has
5 never attended law school. The defendant's filings, however inartfully pleaded, must be
6 liberally construed and held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by
7 lawyers. See Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972).
