Daniel David Rigmaiden, et al.,

No. CR08-814-PHX-DGC
MOTION TO WITHDRAW
MOTION/APPLICATION FOR
PROMETHEUS SUBPOENA DKT. #596

Defendant.

15
16

Defendant, Daniel David Rigmaiden, appearing pro se, respectfully submits this

17 Motion To Withdraw Motion/Application For Prometheus Subpoena Dkt. #596. The
18 defendant is filing this motion to withdraw Dkt. #596 because the prosecution has conceded,
19 for the purposes of litigating the suppression issue, that the FBI's surveillance equipment
20 located the aircard directly inside apartment No. 1122.[1] Due to the prosecution's
21 concession, the defendant no longer has a need for the evidence he previously sought to
22 subpoena from Prometheus Real Estate Group.
23

This motion and all attachments were drafted and prepared by the pro se defendant,

24 however, he authorizes his shadow counsel, Philip Seplow, to file this motion on his behalf
25 using the ECF system. The defendant is appearing pro se and has never attended law school.
26
See Government's Memorandum RE Motion For Discovery, p. 2 (Dkt. #674) (“[T]he
27 1.
United States will agree to allow the Court to factually assume, that, at the conclusion of the
28 July 16, 2008, aircard tracking operation, the FBI located the aircard within Unit 1122 of the
Domocilio [sic] Apartments.” (footnote omitted)).
