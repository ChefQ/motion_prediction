CR-08-814-001-PHX-DGC
RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT
RIGMAIDEN’S MOTION FOR
ORDER REQUIRING
GOVERNMENT TO RELEASE THE
PHYSICAL AIRCARD TO THE
DEFENSE - DOCKET NO. 597

The United States, by and through its attorneys undersigned, respectfully responds to

21

defendant Daniel David Rigmaiden’s Motion for Order Requiring Government to Release the

22

Physical Aircard to the Defense at Docket No. 597 as follows. As the Court has become well

23

aware in this case, the subject aircard, which the government believes defendant used to

24

clandestinely file fraudulent income tax returns electronically and was the source of signals

25

which lead the government to the defendant’s unknown location, is a critical piece of evidence.

26

Defendant recently requested that the aircard be turned over to the defense team for examination.

27

In response to the original request, the government stated, “[t]he prosecution will not agree to

28

turn over the aircard to your investigator, we may be willing to produce it for examination and

testing in our presence and under our supervision - please provide us with a summary of what

2

examination and testing you wish to conduct so that we may consider your request.” (See

3

Defendant’ Motion, Exhibit 2.)

4

Due to the critical nature of this piece of evidence, it is clearly inappropriate for defendant

5

to have complete dominion and control over the evidence. While not suggesting that the defense

6

team would do anything inappropriate with the aircard, it is nevertheless possible that the

7

evidence could be lost, damaged, switched, altered or manipulated while in the custody of a

8

party other than the government and the government would be powerless to prevent any of these

9

events. Due to the fact that there is only one unique aircard, the government’s proposal that

10

would possibly permit examination by the defense team, in a controlled environment and the

11

presence of the government, is eminently reasonable.

12

For the above stated reasons, the United States respectfully requests that defendant’s

13

Motion for Order Requiring Government to Release the Physical Aircard to the Defense be

14

denied.

15

Respectfully submitted this 20th day of September, 2011.
