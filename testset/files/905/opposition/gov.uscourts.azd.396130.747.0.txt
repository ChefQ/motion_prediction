Plaintiff,
GOVERNMENT’S RESPONSE TO
MOTION FOR
RECONSIDERATION RE RELEASE
OF AIRCARD FOR TESTING

v.
Daniel David Rigmaiden, et al.,
Defendant.

15
16

The United States, through undersigned counsel, continues to oppose Defendant’s request

17 to have the Court order the United States to turn over the “Travis Rupard” aircard – a critical
18 piece of trial evidence – to Defendant.
19

Defendant seeks reconsideration by explaining the general nature of the examination and

20 testing that he seeks, but he still fails to explain why the examination and testing cannot be
21 accomplished while the aircard remains in the custody of the United States. As Defendant
22 acknowledges, any test results or reports from the examiner would likely be discoverable in any
23 case. See Fed. R. Crim. Proc. 16(b)(1)(B), 26.2. Defendant expresses concern that the United
24 States might “gain access to defense work product (whether deliberate or accidental) that would
25 not otherwise be disclosed” during the test or “use its authority (whether explicit or implicit) to
26 influence the tests,” but he does not explain further. See Mot. 4. The United States’ primary

1 concerns are that the aircard is not destroyed or permanently altered during any testing. The best
2 means to prevent such either event is require that any testing be conducted while the aircard
3 remains in the custody and under the supervision of the United States.
4

Defendant’s request also appears premature in that he has yet to identify a qualified

5 individual who would conduct the examination or testing. See Mot. at 3 (“The defendant does
6 not currently have an expert appointed to the defense that understands the above explained test
7 and analysis”).
8

Accordingly, defendant’s motion for reconsideration should be denied.

Respectfully submitted this 25th day of January, 2012.
