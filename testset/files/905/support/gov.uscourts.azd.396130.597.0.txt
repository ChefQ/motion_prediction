MOTION FOR ORDER REQUIRING

Defendant.

Defendant, Daniel David Rigmaiden, appearing pro se, respectfully submits this

17 Motion For Order Requiring Government To Release The Physical Aircard To The Defense.
18 In a letter dated July 29, 2011, the government responded to the defendant's request to
19 provide the aircard to the defense so that tests could be performed. See EXHIBIT 01 (the
20 defendant's request) and EXHIBIT 02 (the government's response). In the government's
21 response letter, AUSA Battista stated that “the prosecution will not agree to turn over the
22 aircard to your investigator, [but] we may be willing to produce it for examination and
23 testing in our presence and under our supervision – please provide use with a summary of
24 what examination and testing you wish to conduct so that we may consider your request[.]”
25 Id. The defendant does not agree with the government's proposal and he is filing this motion
26 to request that the Court order the government to transfer the aircard to the defense so that
27 private unmonitored tests may be performed by the defense team.
28

The government is obligated to produce the aircard for defense testing pursuant to
-1-

Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document 597 Filed 08/25/11 Page 2 of 5

1 Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963),
2 and United States v. Gamez-Orduno, 235 F.3d 453, 461 (9th Cir. 2000). The defendant
3 should not be required to reveal even more of his defense strategies simply to gain access to
4 evidence the government is required by law to provide. The defendant has already
5 prematurely revealed to the government far more defense strategies regarding his Motion To
6 Suppress than would ever need to be revealed if the government were not withholding

7 evidence based on frivolous and unfounded claims of privilege.[1] If the defendant explains
8 to the government why the defense needs access to the aircard then the government will gain
9 a further tactical advantage by unnecessarily learning the defendant's defense strategies
10 relating to tests that need to be performed on the aircard.[2] The defendant respectfully
11 requests that the Court (1) order the government to transfer possession of the aircard to the
12 defense, (2) order the defense to maintain and document a chain of custody for the aircard
13 while it is in the possession of the defense, and (3) order the defendant to instruct his defense
14 members to return the aircard and full chain of custody documentation to the government
15 once the defendant determines that defense testing is complete.
16

This motion and all attachments were drafted and prepared by the pro se defendant,

17 however, he authorizes his shadow counsel, Philip Seplow, to file this motion and all
18 attachments on his behalf using the ECF system. The defendant is appearing pro se and has
19 never attended law school. The defendant's filings, however inartfully pleaded, must be
20 liberally construed and held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by
21 lawyers. See Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972).
For example, the defendant prepared stipulations that would alleviate the defendant's
22 1.
need for the privileged evidence and even agreed to a prior government request, made by
23 AUSA James Knapp, to have the parties sign stipulations under seal to protect government
interests. After preparing draft stipulations and forwarding them to the government, the
24 prosecution refused all proposed stipulations and made no suggestions as to changes that
would make them more appealing to the government's interests. Even stipulations regarding
25 clearly undisputed facts such as how many destination IP addresses were seized, the design
of the Domicilio apartment complex, the details of the aircard, etc., were all rejected by the
26 government. The government likely had no interest in stipulations from the beginning and
was entertaining the issue to gain a tactical advantage.

2.
The defendant is willing, however, to advise the Court ex parte on the nature of the
planned
tests and why they are essential to the preparation of the defendant's Motion To
28
Suppress.
