Case 3:07-cv-05739-SC Document6 Filed 12/07/2007 Page3of7

I. INTRODUCTION
This is a "Fear of Identity Theft" case. GAP has filed a motion for judgment on the

pleadings on the grounds that Plaintiff lacks standing to pursue his claims or, in the alternative,
that he fails to state a claim for relief. The Court would reach this motion to strike only if it
determines that (i) Plaintiff has standing; and (ii) the Complaint states a claim.

If the Court were to reach this motion, it should strike the class allegations for several

reasons. First, a class action cannot be certified where claimants have not suffered actual harm.

Second, Plaintiff fails to allege the key elements for a class action and the Complaint lacks
commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation.

For these reasons, GAP moves to strike the class allegations in the Complaint.

Il. ARGUMENT

A. The Legal Standard.
Under Rule 23(c)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, this Court is fully empow-

ered to determine "at an early practicable time" whether an action is to be maintained as a class
action. Additionally, Rule 23(d)(4) expressly authorizes the Court to issue orders "requiring that
the pleadings be amended to eliminate therefrom allegations as to representation of absent
persons, and that the action proceed accordingly." Consistent with these rules, motions to strike
are a well-recognized means of attacking inadequate class allegations such as these. See 7A
Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure 0x00A7 1760, at 131 (2d ed. 1986); Cook -
County College Teachers Union v. Byrd, 456 F.2d 882, 885 (7th Cir. 1972} ("One opposing a
class action may move for an order determining that the action may not be maintained as a class
suit"); SPG Inv. Ass'n v. Berry Petroleum Corp., No. 4-84-159, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12093
(D. Minn. Dec. 30, 1987) (granting defendants' motion for denial of class certification); 7A
Wright et al., supra, 0x00A7 1785, at 89 ("Either plaintiff or defendant may move for a determination
under Rule 23(c)(1)").

The plaintiff always bears the burden of establishing all prerequisites to the maintenance
of a class action under Rule 23. See, cent.g., Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S, 591, 613

(1997). This is so even in the context of a defendant's motion challenging the propriety of the

class allegations. See Rodrigues v. Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co., 70 F.R.D. 414, 416 (N.D. Cal. 1976)
("[E]ven upon a defendant's motion for determination that an action not be maintained as a class
action, the burden is upon plaintiff to establish that the requirements of Rule 23 are satisfied");
Brown v. Milwaukee Spring Co., 82 F.R.D. 103, 104 (ED. Wis. 1979) ("While the plaintiff has
the burden of establishing her right to maintain a class action, the defendants may test the propri-
ety of the action by means of a motion for denial of class certification"); Hylaszek v. Aetna Life
Ins. Co., No. 94 C 5961, 1998 US. Dist. LEXIS 10209, at *4 (N.D. Ill. June 29, 1998) (same);
Sperberg v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., 61 F.R.D. 70, 75 (N.D. Ohio 1973) (same).

For the reasons explained in greater detail below, the Court should exercise its authority
under Rule 23 to strike Plaintiffs class allegations.

B. No Class' Can Be Certified Because No One Has Suffered Actual Harm.

A class may not be certified where claimants have not suffered real harm. See Amchem
Prods., Inc., 521 U.S. at 613 (affirming denial of class certification where some members of the
class had developed asbestos-related injuries while others were only at risk of developing such
injuries); Valentino v. Carter-Wallace, Inc., 97 F.3d 1227, 1234 (9th Cir. 1996) (reversing class
certification where only a smal] percentage of the class suffered actual injury from a drug). Here,
Mr. Ruiz fails to allege that any member of the putative class has actually suffered harm from-as
opposed to merely being exposed to a risk of-identity theft. (See, e.g., Compl., | 56 ("Plaintiff
and the Class have been harmed by the release for [sic] their personal information by putting
them at an increased risk of identity theft.").)

For this reason, the Court should strike Plaintiffs class allegations.

Cc The Complaint Fails To Satisfy The Elements of Rule 23.

A party seeking to establish a class must plead and prove: (1) numerosity;

(2) commonality; (3) typicality; and (4) adequacy of representation. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). In

addition to proving these elements, a party must meet at least one of the requirements of Rule

 

' The Complaint asserts the wrong dates for the class. The affected job applicants applied
for employment between July 2006 and June 2007 (not July 2007). (Compl., 0x00A7 44.)

23(b).? See Zinser v. Accufix Research Inst., Inc,, 253 F.3d 1180, 1186 (9th Cir. 2001). Failure to
sufficiently plead and prove any one of these elements precludes class certification. fd This

Complaint lacks commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation.

1. Common Issues Do Not Predominate.

Plaintiff must demonstrate that common questions of law or fact exist and "predominate
over any questions affecting only individual members." Amchem Prods., Inc., 521 U.S. at 615;
Valentino, 97 F.3d at 1234. If "matertal variations exist as to the law or facts involved with
individual class member injuries, then the commonality requirement [is] not... met." La Duke v.
Nelson, 762 F.2d 1318, 1332 (9th Cir. 1985); Hum v. Dericks, 162 F.R.D. 628 (D. Haw. 1995)
(denying certification where the fact of injury is an element of the claim and is not common).

Even if the Complaint alleged that some of the putative class members suffered an injury
(which it does not), individual issues would predominate. This class contemplates two kinds of
claimants: Those who have had a manifest injury and those whose injury is only latent. A person
who has his credit card stolen or health insurance misused is very differently situated from
someone who only worries about that happening. Offering more identity theft insurance (to
$50,000, as requested) and increasing the period of credit monitoring to five years provides no
relief to someone in the "manifest injury" group. (See Compl., 0x00A7 68(g).) Of course, all this is
hypothetical, as Plaintiff has not alleged that he or any other class member has suffered injury.

Moreover, proving causation among the "manifest injury" group will require the determi-
nation of myriad individualized questions: Did the person's loss stem from the stolen laptops as
opposed to, say, a misplaced credit card or a TJ Maxx-type intrusion? Causation cannot be

proved on a classwide basis.

 

* Plaintiff must plead that the putative class meets the requirements of at least one of the three
subsections of Rule 23(b): (1) there is a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications which
would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the defendants; (2) final injunctive or
declaratory relief is appropriate for the class as a whole because defendants acted on grounds
generally applicable to the class; or (3) common questions of law or fact predominate over
individual! issues and the class action is superior to other methods for the fair and efficient
adjudication of the case. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)-(3).

2. Plaintiff's Claims Are Not Typical and He is Not "Adequate."

A named plaintiff who himself cannot state a case or controversy is not typical of those
who can. See Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508 (Sth Cir. 1992). Alternatively,
such a person is not an "adequate representative" capable of seeking relief on behalf of those who
have incurred actual injury. O Shea vy. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 494 (1974).

Furthermore, a named plaintiff must be a member of the class he seeks to represent. See
General Tel. Co. of the Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 156 (1982) ("a class representative
must be part of the class and `possess the same interest and suffer the same injury' as the class
members.") (internal citation omitted); Hanon, 976 F.2d at 508 (typicality tests "whether other
members have the same or similar injury, whether the action is based on conduct which is not
unique to the named plaintiffs, and whether the other class members have been injured by the
same course of conduct.").

~ Mr. Ruiz is only a "latent injury" claimant. His only injury is a worry. As such, he cannot
represent those claimants who have been injured, if any there are. As to them, Mr. Ruiz stands in
a different position than class members he would represent. See O'Shea, 414 U.S. at 494. For
Plaintiff to represent their interests would violate due process. See Amchem Prods., Inc., 521
US. at 624-626. .

Even as to the "latent injury" group, Plaintiff is neither adequate nor typical. Consider the
one-year credit monitoring program that GAP offered. (Compl., 936.) Either Mr. Ruiz accepted
that benefit or he did not." If he did not accept this benefit, then he is not typical of those tens of
thousands of putative class members who did. If he did accept, he is not typical of those who
declined. Those persons are presumed to have decided that even one year's worth of free credit
monitoring service is not something they want. How, then, is someone who accepted that benefit
an adequate representative as to a claim that seeks to force on absent class members five more

years of a service they have decided they don't want?

 

? Knowing Mr. Ruiz's decision is not necessary in order to rule on this motion because,
either way, he is neither typical nor adequate.

3. A Class Action is Not "Superior" to Other Proceedings.

Rule 23(b)(3) requires that a class action be manageable and superior to other proceed-
ings. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3); see also Zinser, 253 F.3d at 1190. A class action is not the
superior means of proceeding in this case. GAP has already offered a remedy on a classwide
basis. (See Compl., { 36.) Those who did not accept have signaled that they are not interested in
having Mr. Ruiz's remedy forced upon them.

Those who wanted free credit monitoring have already opted into the GAP program. For
them, GAP has given a remedy beyond what the law requires. Indeed, in most "Fear of ID Theft"
cases, the defendant offered no credit monitoring. See e.g. Key v. DSW, Inc., 454 F. Supp. 2d
684, 690 (S.D. Ohic 2006); Pisciotta v. Old Nat'l Bancorp., 499 F.3d 629 (7th Cir. 2007). Those
claims were nevertheless dismissed.

Here, GAP offered one-year's worth of credit monitoring, more than any federal or state
law requires. For these reasons, a class action is not a superior means of proceeding in this case.
WI. CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, GAP respectfully requests that this Court enter an order

striking the class allegations from Plaintiff's complaint.
