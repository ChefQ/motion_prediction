STATEMENT OF FACTS
1. Harris executed a mortgage promissory note (the “Note”) with Lehman Brothers
Bank (“Lehman”) on April 3, 2007 in order to Purchase property formally known as

2. As security for the Note, Harris granted Lehman a deed of trust (“Trust Deed”),

which was recorded against the Property on April 5, 2007. See Trust Deed, attached
as Exhibit 1.

3. The Trust Deed named Lehman as the “Lender,” but recited that:

“MERS” is the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. MERS is a separate
corporation that is acting solely as nominee for Lender and Lender’s successors and
assigns. MERS is the beneficiary under this security instrument. (emphasis
original)

See Trust Deed, at ¶ (E).
4. The Trust Deed also declares, under the heading “TRANSFERS OF RIGHTS IN THE
PROPERTY”:

The beneficiary of this Security Instrument is MERS (solely as nominee for Lender
and Lender’s successors and assigns) and the successors and assigns of MERS.
See Trust Deed, at ¶ (R).

5. The Trust Deed also recites that:

Borrower understands and agrees that MERS holds only legal title to the interests
granted by Borrower in this Security Instrument, but, if necessary to comply with
2

Case 2:10-cv-00690-TC Document 25

law or custom, MERS (as nominee for Lender and Lender’s successors and assigns)
has the right: to exercise any or all of those interests, including, but not limited to,
the right to foreclose and sell the Property; and to take any action required of
Lender including, but not limited to, releasing and cancelling this Security
Instrument.
See Trust Deed, at ¶ (R).

6. The Trust Deed further recites that:

Substitute Trustee. Lender, at its option, may from time to time remove Trustee
and appoint a successor trustee to any Trustee appointed hereunder.
See Trust Deed, at ¶ 24.

7. In September of 2008, Lehman filed for bankruptcy because of liabilities for its subprime lending, making it the largest failure of an investment bank in history. See

Lehman Brothers completes third sale of assets, Barclays Capital Press Release, and
9/23/10 Bloomberg News, attached as Exhibit 2. Lehman sold of most, if not all, of
its assets in order to liquidate creditor claim
bankruptcy. Id.

and Lehman has yet to exit

8. Upon information and belief, therefore, Harris’ Note may have been assigned to Bain
Capital and/or Hellman & Frieman or to Barclay’s Capital as of September 2008.

9. Harris defaulted on his obligations under the Note and Trust Deed as of May 1, 2009.

10. Harris made efforts to secure a forbearance or modification of his mortgage

obligations, but was unable to determine with whom he should negotiate when he
was provided with the foreclosure-related notices on his property. See SOT, NOD,
infra.

11. On August 14, 2009, MERS executed a substitution of trustee (“SOT”) on the
Property, purporting to substitute licensed Utah attorney James Woodall
(“Woodall”) as trustee. See SOT, attached as Exhibit 3.

12. The SOT was recorded on August 18, 2009, with instructions to return the recorded
document to the law offices of Woodall. Id.

13. By recording the SOT, Woodall published all statements therein to the public at
large.

14. Woodall also caused the SOT to be delivered to Harris.

15. The SOT declares that Woodall is appointed successor trustee under a Deed of Trust
“to secure certain obligations in favor of MORTGAGE ELECTRONIC REGISTRATION
SYSTEMS, INC. as Beneficiary . . .” Id.

16. The SOT makes no mention of Lehman or any other lender by assignment, nor does

it make any indication that MERS is acting as “nominee,” bare-legal title holder, or
agent. See id.

17. The SOT was executed by “Susan Smothers” “Assistant Secretary of MERS” and the
executing authority is “Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc.” Id.

18. Susan Smothers (“Smothers”) is not, in fact, a bona-fide employee of MERS, but is an
employee of Cal-Western.

See Smothers Bio, attached as Exhibit 4; see also

Smothers’ Trustee’s Deed, attached as Exhibit 5.

19. On August 17, 2009, Woodall recorded a notice of default (“NOD”) on Harris’

Filed 10/08/10 Page 5 of 34

Property. The NOD was recorded on August 18, 2009. See Notice of Default,
attached as Exhibit 6.

20. By recording the NOD, Woodall published all statements therein to the public at
large.

21. Woodall also caused the NOD to be delivered to Harris.

22. Woodall’s NOD declares notice that Harris, as Trustor, had defaulted on a deed of

trust “in favor of MORTGAGE ELECTRONIC REGISTRATION SYSTEMS, INC. as
Beneficiary . . . .” Id. The NOD further declared that “the beneficial interest under
such Deed of Trust and the obligations secured thereby are presently owned by
MORTGAGE ELECTRONIC REGISTRATION SYSTEMS, INC.” (emphasis added) Id.

23. The NOD further declares that Harris was in default for failure to pay “all

subsequent sums advanced by beneficiary pursuant to the terms and conditions
of said deed of trust” and that, “by reason of such default, MORTGAGE ELECTRONIC

REGISTRATION SYTEMS, INC. the Beneficiary under such Deed of Trust, has
executed and delivered to said Trustee a written declaration of default and demand

for sale, and has deposited with him all documents evidencing the obligation
secured thereby . . . ” (emphasis added). Id.

24. The NOD makes no mention of Lehman or any other lender by assignment, nor does

it make any indication that MERS is acting as “nominee,” bare-legal title holder, or
agent. See id.

25. Woodall regularly tells borrowers and attorneys who call him in an effort to secure a
modification, forbearance, or postponement of sale, that he has no authority to
provide such relief and that the borrower or attorney must contact the lender.

26. In March, 2010, Woodall caused to be posted in a conspicuous fashion a Notice of
Trustee’s Sale on Harris’ Property, containing the same or similar statements

contained in the NOD, whereby all passersby could see and read the statements
included therein.

27. On April 29, 2010, Woodall conducted a public auction and sold Harris’ Property to

Aurora for the “price bid” of $571,571.00” according to a trustee’s deed (“Trustee’s
Deed”) Woodall executed and recorded the same day. See Trustee’s Deed, attached
as Exhibit 7.

28. By recording the Trustee’s Deed, Woodall published all statements therein to the
public at large.

29. Woodall also published similar statements, at least three times, in publications with
broad circulation throughout the state of Utah.

30. Upon information and belief, $571,571.00 represented the exact or approximate

amount of the indebtedness due on Harris’ Note and Aurora purchased the Property
through a credit bid.

31. The Trustee’s Deed again represented that Harris had conveyed his property in trust
“to secure certain obligations in favor of MORTGAGE ELECTRONIC REGISTRATION

SYSTEMS, INC. as Beneficiary . . . .” See Id. The deed makes no reference to Lehman
or to MERS as “nominee,” agent or bare legal title-holder for Lehman (or its
successors and assigns). See id.

32. On October 3, 2010, Harris discovered new information, from the MERS database,
indicating that Bank of America, N.A., (“BAC”) is the purported “investor” which
owns his mortgage obligations. See October 3 MERS Loan ID, attached as Exhibit 8.

33. The recorded chain of title on Harris’ property discloses no recorded interest in BAC
either before, or after, the April 29 public auction. See Title Abstract, attached as
Exhibit 9.

34. According to MERS, as of October 3, 2010, Aurora is merely the servicer of Harris’
mortgage. Id.

35. In the last week of September, 2010, three of the largest mortgage lenders and
servicers in the United States, including BAC, made national news headlines by
announcing that they had prosecuted tens of thousands of foreclosures against
homeowners across the country by swearing, under oath, that they physically

possessed note obligations entitling them to foreclose when, in fact, they lacked or
could not prove possession of the instruments. See GMAC Suspends Evictions in 23
States, JPMorgan Chase Halts 56,000 foreclosures, and BAC Halts Foreclosures in 23

States, attached as Exhibit 10. Yesterday, October 3, the New York Times published

Foreclosure Crisis, attached as Exhibit 11. The Times articles is a perfect illustration

of Harris’ claims.

ARGUMENT 1

I.
Harris has stated a claim for (1) declaratory judgment that Defendants
violated Title 57 by based on MERS claims of ownership of the Note and Trust Deed;
(2) violations of the FDCPA when Defendants have violated Title 57 and used
“deceptive forms” to attempt to collect a debt.
A. Harris has properly stated claims for declaratory judgment.
MERS is not the beneficiary of Harris’ Trust Deed, despite the language of

paragraphs (E) and (R). According to Utah law, the “beneficiary” of a trust deed “means the
person named or otherwise designated in a trust deed as the person for whose benefit a

trust deed is given, or his successor in interest.” U.C.A. 57-1-19(1) (1988). Additionally,

only the beneficiary may substitute the trustee to a mortgage: “[t]he beneficiary may
appoint a successor trustee at any time by filing for record in the office of the county
recorder of each county in which the trust property . . . is situated, a substitution of

trustee.” U.C.A. § 57-1-22 (2002). Additionally, the substitution of trustee must “be
executed and acknowledged by all of the beneficiaries under the trust deed or their
successors in interest.” Id.

MERS maintains that it is the “mortgagee of record,” or, in this case, “the

beneficiary” under the trust deed even though its ownership of the mortgage is purely
1

The arguments in this Memorandum, like the arguments in the Complaint, borrow heavily, and often directly,
from University of Utah Associate Dean Christopher Peterson’s law review article entitled Foreclosure, Subprime
Mortgage Lending, and The Mortgage Electronic Registration System, attached as Exhibit 14.

8

Case 2:10-cv-00690-TC Document 25

fictional. According to Black’s Law Dictionary, a “mortgagee” is “[o]ne to whom property is
mortgaged; the mortgage creditor, or lender. – Also termed mortgage-holder.” 2 MERS is

never entitled to receive the borrower’s monthly payments, nor is it entitled to receive the

proceeds of a foreclosure or deed of trust sale. MERS has no actual financial interest in any

mortgage loan. MERS does not, and cannot, provide lien releases of the mortgages it
purports to own. Because MERS does not actually advance any loan principal to the

homeowner and because it does not have the right to receive any payments from the
borrower, MERS is not the actual party in interest in any foreclosure proceeding.

In order to move foreclosures along as quickly as possible, MERS allows actual

mortgagees and loan assignees or their servicers to bring foreclosure actions in MERS’

name as “nominee”, rather than their own. Once a loan is assigned to MERS, public records
can no longer reveal who (or what) actually owns a lien on property. This is perfectly

illustrated in the present case, where the original lender (Lehman) went bankrupt because
of sub-prime lending and sold its loan portfolios in bankruptcy to other parties. Harris is

supposed to take for granted that MERS and Woodall are acting on actual authority of the

present note-holder, even though public records for real property in Salt Lake County still
indicate that Lehman is the note-holder, an improbability because of Lehman’s various
asset sales in bankruptcy.

Woodall’s NOD fails to identify the creditor or note-holder whose authority he is

purportedly acting upon. The NOD declares that MERS is the lender (holds the beneficial

interest), suggesting that Harris should contact MERS if he would like to cure his default or
negotiate a loan modification. But MERS has no authority to receive payment or to modify
the Note.

The roles and rights of various players in a lending transaction—such as the

borrower, the lender, and the trustee of the deed of trust—have been well settled. One of

these settled principles is that the beneficiary of the deed of trust is the party to whom the
debt is owed. See Hellman v. Capurro, 549 P.2d 750, 751 (Nev. 1976) (“A mortgagee or a
beneficiary to a deed to trust is entitled to only one satisfaction of his debt.” (emphasis

added)); see also Monterey S.P. P’ship v. W.L. Bangham, Inc., 777 P.2d 623, 627 (Cal. 1989)

(“[A] deed of trust typically secures a debt owed the beneficiary . . . .”). MERS’ membership
rules clearly state that members are never permitted to claim MERS is a “note-owner” as

part of foreclosure proceedings. 3 On September 25, 2009, R.K. Arnold, the President and

CEO of MERSCORP, Inc. – the parent of MERS - was deposed in Alabama. In his deposition,

Arnold admitted that MERS does not have a beneficial interest in any mortgage; that it does
not loan money; and that it does not suffer a default if a borrower fails to repay a mortgage
loan. 4

The “nominee/beneficiary” language in Harris’ Trust Deed describing MERS is

schizophrenic and mutually exclusive: a “nominee” is an agent for the mortgagee, while the

“beneficiary” is the mortgagee itself. MERS’ description of itself is false on its face, because
the same entity cannot simultaneously be both “solely” an agent and a principal with
respect to the same property right. 5

The reason for MERS’ schizophrenic description is straightforward: when MERS is

challenged in litigation related to its standing to foreclose, MERS takes the position, as its

corporate counsel explains, that it “gets its authority to assign and/or discharge a mortgage
because MERS is the mortgagee, and as such holds legal title to the mortgage.” 6 When

MERS is challenged in litigation based on fraud, deceptive practices, or other statutory

consumer protection claims associated with loans registered in its system, MERS argues it
is merely an agent (“nominee”) without any exposure to liability. 7

See Restatement (Third) of Agency Law § 1.01 (“Agency is the fiduciary relationship that arises when one person
(a “principal”) manifests assent to another person (an “agent”) that the agent shall act on the principal’s behalf
and subject to the principal’s control. . . .”). Moreover, neither the popularity of MERS’ self-characterization, nor its
contractual recitation, are controlling. Id. § 1.02 (“An agency relationship arises only when the elements stated in §
1.01 are present. Whether a relationship is characterized as agency in an agreement between the parties or in the
context of industry or popular usage is not controlling.”).

The language of the Trust Deed does not determine the respective roles of the

parties to the transaction. Mortgage contracts are construed based on the economic

realities of the transaction, and not upon the language the parties use to describe the

bargain. 8 The economic reality of a mortgage transaction clearly indicates that MERS is not
a mortgagee or an assignee. There are three fundamental economic reasons why MERS is
not the mortgagee: (1) MERS does not fund any loans; (2) homeowners do not promise to
pay MERS any money; and (3) MERS is never entitled to receive the proceeds of a

foreclosure sale. These funds go to the actual mortgagee (or assignee) that is the true
owner of the lien.

In Harris’s case, the recorded documents on title subsequent to the Trust Deed (SOT,

NOD, Trustee’s Deed) make absolutely no reference to any identified lender as beneficiary
nor do they characterize MERS as “nominee”, agent, or legal-title holder for a beneficiary.

Every single reference to MERS in these documents clearly and conspicuously declares that
MERS is “the Beneficiary”; that the trust deed obligations are “in favor of [MERS], as

Benficiary”; and most significantly, the NOD declares that “the beneficial interest under
such Deed of Trust and the obligations secured thereby are presently owned by

MORTGAGE ELECTRONIC REGISTRATION SYSTEMS, INC.” (emphasis added) See NOD,

supra. The NOD is explicitly claiming that MERS “presently owned” the Note. This claim is
in direct violation of the MERS membership rules, as stated supra.

MERS’ claim that it owns legal title to mortgages by virtue of assignment is also false

on its face because MERS does not pay the mortgage originator value in exchange for the

mortgage. On the contrary, the originator or servicer pays MERS to take the “assignment.”
Under this “assignment,” MERS is still not entitled to receive repayment of the mortgage
loan, nor is it entitled to the proceeds of a foreclosure sale.” The fee MERS is paid is to

provide recordkeeping and foreclosure services, not to own a lien on a family residence.
Federal consumer protection and bankruptcy law also show that MERS does not

own legal title to loans registered in its database. Under the Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”)

and the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (“HOEPA”), a mortgage assignee can be
liable for an original lender’s violations of those statutes. If MERS owns legal title to the

mortgages in its database, it would have taken on liability for tens of millions of residential
mortgages, liability the company has repeatedly disclaimed.

MERS’ claim that it owns legal title to mortgages is further undermined by the long-

standing rule that a mortgage follows a negotiated promissory note. 9 Courts are virtually

unanimous in holding that, where a mortgage lender with a promissory note negotiates

that note to a holder, the holder of the promissory note also obtains any mortgage securing

that note. 10 According to Harris’ Trust Deed, MERS holds the beneficial interest in the

mortgage even when a non-MERS member purchases his Note (“[t]he beneficiary of this

Security Instrument is MERS (solely as nominee for Lender and Lender’s successors and
assigns) and the successors and assigns of MERS. “). This is in direct violation of wellsettled property and agency law.

The records of the Salt Lake County recorder show no assignment or conveyance of

Harris’ mortgage to any party before the conveyance purportedly made by the April 29,

2010 Trustee’s Deed. Courts in New York have confirmed that “foreclosure of a mortgage

may not be brought by one who has no title to it . . . .” Kluge v. Kugazy, 145 A.D.2d 537, 538,

536 N.Y.S.2d 92 (1988). The New York Appellate Division, Third Department recently ruled
that an assignee of a mortgage does not have a right or standing to foreclose a mortgage

unless the assignment is complete at the time of commencing the action. Lasalle Bank Nat.
Ass'n v. Ahearn, 59 A.D.3d 911, 875, 912, N.Y.S.2d 595, 597 (2009). Thus even the true

not Lehman, a bankrupt institution which appears to have sold most of its loan assets to
creditors in bankruptcy.

In a widely cited decision, the U.S. Supreme Court held that “[t]he note and mortgage

are inseparable; the former as essential, the latter as an incident. An assignment of the

note carries the mortgage with it, while an assignment of the latter is a nullity.” Carpenter v.
Longan, 83 U.S. 271, 274 (1872), attached as Exhibit 12. As Carpenter mandates, the

assignment of the beneficial interest to MERS is “a nullity” when MERS was not also

assigned the Note (MERS’s membership rules prohibit “note ownership” claims, supra).
No state recording statute, including Utah’s, authorizes mortgagees or their

assignees to vicariously record using the name of an agent or nominee. See U.C.A § 17-21-1

et seq.; see also U.C.A. § 57-1-20 (2001). Utah’s Recording Act also specifies that the name

of the mortgagee or assignee must be included so that records and indexes can be drawn

up from the names of both parties. U.C.A 17-21 et seq. While the record does not disclose

whether Harris’ Note was securitized, Lehman was one of the pioneers of the securitization
of sub-prime loans into mortgage-backed securities (“MBSs”) and collateralized-debt

obligations (“CDOs”). But Harris’ claim does not depend at all on whether his Note has

been securitized. Because the current note-holder has violated Titles 17 and 57 of the Utah
Code, Harris could not determine who had authority to negotiate a forbearance or
resolution of his default.

In thousands of cases across the country, including the present case, MERS claims

that it owns legal title to the mortgage and therefore is entitled to foreclose. However, an
economic analysis of the claim that MERS owns the lien is demonstrably false when MERS
does not own the proceeds of the sale generated from exercising the lien.

Even if this Court accepts MERS’ suspect claim that it owns legal title to a mortgage,

nominal ownership does permit MERS to behave as if it is the mortgagee:

Prior to the introduction of MERS to the mortgage markets, in the history of the
Anglo-American common law, there has been no case that holds that a debt
collection plaintiff that lacks any beneficial interest in the debt has standing to sue
even where legal title to that debt is held by a trustee. Nor has there ever been a
case that holds there are two separate legal titles to the same property. . . . To grant
MERS standing based on legal title held by someone else [the trustee of the security,
or the actual lender/mortgagee], is to treat the notion of legal title as some magical
nonsense where ownership means nothing other than a willingness on the part of
the courts to let financiers seize homes however is most convenient for them. 11
Currently, there is a growing split in authority on whether MERS, and its appointed

agents like Woodall, have standing to bring foreclosure actions against homeowners.

There are three general propositions which are accurate characterizations of the split in

authority: first, state court appellate authority across the country has been resounding and
near-unanimous in holding that MERS is not the beneficiary of any mortgage promissory

note or deed of trust, despite the common language of MERS’ trust deeds. 12 Second, federal

bankruptcy courts are near-unanimous in holding that MERS is not a real-party-in-interest
(“beneficiary”) entitled to assert a proof of claim or to move for relief from an automatic
stay. 13 Lastly, the trial court authority (often unpublished like Rodeback) cited by

Defendants upholding MERS’ agent authority as “nominee” for an original lender pursuant
to the language of the trust deed are generally conclusory opinions that refuse to look
beyond MERS’ claims of nominal ownership. 14

In 2009, the Arkansas Supreme Court held that “MERS is not the beneficiary, even

though it is so designated in the deed of trust. Pulaski Mortgage, as the lender on the deed

of trust, was the beneficiary. It receives the payments on the debt.” Mortgage Elec.
Registration Sys., Inc. v. S.W. Homes of Ark., 301 S.W.3d 1, at 4-5 (Ark. 2009), attached as
Exhibit 13.

In 2009, the Kansas Supreme Court, based on a comprehensive analysis of the trust

deed and the concepts of “nominee”, “beneficiary” and “mortgagee”, also rejected the
notion that MERS is a real party in interest to a foreclosure action. See Landmark v. Kesler,
216 P.3d 158, 168 (2009), attached as Exhibit 14.

In 2009, the Missouri Court of Appeals found that MERS could not foreclose when

“[t]he practical effect of splitting the deed of trust from the promissory note is to make it

Walker 10-21656-E-11 (E.D.Cal.2010) (unpublished opinion).

See, e.g., In re Sina, 2006 WL 2729544 (Minn.App. 2006) (“Although the record shows that ALS serviced the
mortgage, the assignment of the mortgage was recorded in MERS’s name. And by agreement, MERS retained the
power to foreclose the mortgage in its name. Because MERS is the record assignee of the mortgage, we conclude
that MERS has standing to foreclose the property by advertisement.”).

impossible for the holder of the note to foreclose, unless of the holder of the deed of trust is

the agent of the holder of the note . . . . The mortgage loan becomes ineffectual when the
note holder did not also hold the deed of trust.” See Bellistri v. Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC,
284 S.W.3d 619, 623 (Mo.App.2009), attached as Exhibit 15.

The Nebraska Supreme Court has “conclude[d] that MERS does not acquire

mortgage loans” because “simply stated, MERS has no independent right to collect on any
debt because MERS itself has not extended credit, and none of the mortgage debtors owe

MERS any money.” Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v. Neb. Dep’t of Banking & Fin., 704
N.W.2d 784, 788 (Neb. 2005), attached as Exhibit 16. This conclusion relied upon MERS’s
arguments to that court that it “only holds legal title to members’ mortgages in a nominee

capacity and is contractually prohibited from exercising any rights with respect to the
mortgages (i.e., foreclosure) without the authorization of the members.

Further, MERS

argues that it does not own the promissory notes secured by the mortgages and has no
right to the payments made on the notes.” Id. at 787 (emphasis added).

Additionally, numerous bankruptcy courts have also found that, because MERS

never holds the promissory note, its assignment of the deed of trust has no force. See In re

Wilhelm, 407 B.R. 392 (Bankr.D.Idaho 2009) (standard mortgage note language does not

expressly or implicitly authorize MERS to transfer the note), attached as Exhibit 17; In re

Vargas, 396 B.R. 511, 517 (Bankr.C.D.Cal.2008) (“[I]f FHM has transferred the note, MERS is

Walker, Case No. 10-21656-E-11 (E.D.Cal.2010) (unpublished opinion) (“to perfect the

transfer of mortgage paper as collateral the owner should physically deliver the note to the

conveyance, or as unperfected . . . . MERS is not the owner of the underlying note and
therefore could not transfer the note, the beneficial interest in the deed of trust, or
foreclose upon the property secured by the deed.”), attached as Exhibit 19.

A federal district court in Ohio dismissed 27 foreclosure cases when the lenders

could not prove they were the holder and owner of the Notes and Mortgages. In re

Foreclosure Cases, Case No. 1:07-cv-02282-CAB (N.D.Ohio.2007) (unpublished opinion),
attached as Exhibit 20. In the Ohio case, the foreclosing party was not referenced in the
recorded chain of title, which is identical on the facts to Harris’ case. Additionally, Ohio

law, like Utah law, makes mortgage assignments subject to recording. See U.C.A §17-21 et
seq.; see also U.C.A. § 57-1-20. Judge Boyko concluded that: “[n]either the fluidity of the

secondary mortgage market, nor monetary or economic considerations of the parties, nor
the convenience of the litigants supersede those obligations [to prove possession of the
endorsed notes].” In re Foreclosure Cases, supra, at p. 5.

Defendant’s reliance on the recent unpublished federal trial court decisions in

Burnett and Rodeback is unpersuasive. See Rodeback v. Utah Financial, et al., Case No. 1:0919

Case 2:10-cv-00690-TC Document 25

cv-00134-TC (N.D.Utah.2010) and Burnett v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Sys., Inc.,

Case No. 1:09-cv-00069-DAK (N.D.Utah.2009), attached to Defendant’s Memorandum. In
Burnett, the primary focus of Judge Kimball’s analysis focused on Burnett’s failure to

properly plead her FDCPA claims. In the context of evaluating whether Woodall had the

right of possession to plaintiff’s property and therefore had the right to demand payment of
the debt, the court simply recited the language of the trust deed (language identical to

Harris’) and concluded, without any analysis, that MERS had authority it claimed in the
deed. Burnett is further distinguishable because, in that case, MERS was acting as the

identified nominee for the original lender. In the present case, as the SOT, NOD and

Trustee’s Deed clearly illustrate, MERS is acting sua sponte, as “the Beneficiary” which

“presently owns the [note] obligations secured” by the Trust Deed. See SOT, NOD, and
Trustee’s Deed, supra.

Judge Campbell’s decision in Rodeback, decided earlier this month, is also

distinguishable from the present case. Like Burnett, where the primary issue was the
pleading requirements of the FDCPA, the primary issue in Rodeback was whether the
defendants violated RESPA by failing to respond to a qualified written request. In the
concluding paragraph of the opinion, this Court summarily concluded, without any

analysis, that MERS had authority to foreclose based on the language in the trust deed,
which, once again, is identical to Harris’. Therefore, Rodeback, at best, stands for the

proposition that MERS has “nominee” or limited agent authority to act at the instruction of
20

Case 2:10-cv-00690-TC Document 25

Filed 10/08/10 Page 21 of 34

the original lender, assuming the grant of authority in the trust deed is lawful and binding
upon the parties, an issue that none of this Court’s MERS-related decisions have fully
addressed.

Harris is an unsophisticated consumer who was presented with a large stack of

documents at closing and instructed to “sign here” dozens of times, without any

opportunity to fully read or understand many of the technical provisions of the documents

he was asked to sign. At no point in time did anyone discuss MERS or its relationship to his
mortgage. At all times, Harris believed he was interacted with Lehman only as his lender.

Defendants have forced the MERS grant of authority upon borrowers like Harris in tens of

millions of loans nationwide in an effort to shift foreclosure liability and lower transaction

costs for the securitization of mortgages. The Trust Deed’s purported grant of authority as
“Beneficiary” is an adhesion contract, which should be void for public policy. At minimum,
it is a unilateral mistake committed with full knowledge by Defendants who employ the
MERS masquerade in their regular course of business without ever disclosing it to a
borrower.

Rodeback and Burnett are precisely the types of examples that Dean Peterson refers

to in his evaluation of the split in authority nationwide concerning MERS’ (and therefore
Woodall’s) authority to foreclose. 15 There is no decision in MERS favor, from any court,

that has ruled that MERS is the “Beneficiary” or mortgagee based on an in-depth analysis of
the economic behavior of the parties. The decisions in MERS’ favor do nothing more than
15

See Peterson, supra.

21

Case 2:10-cv-00690-TC Document 25

recite the language of the trust deed. To permit a party to selfishly define its role in a

mortgage transaction, regardless of economic realities of the transaction, contravenes wellestablished principles of contract, property, and agency law. To permit MERS to evade
liability for violations of federal lending laws by accepting its claim that it is “solely

nominee” for the lender on the one hand, while permitting MERS to prosecute tens of

thousands of foreclosures nationwide by accepting its claim that it is the “mortgagee” or

holder of the “beneficial interest” of mortgages is an affront to public policy and consumer’s
ability to protect themselves against the overreaching of the predatory lenders who

invented MERS: “MERS represents the mortgage industry’s best efforts to create a single,
national foreclosure plaintiff that always has foreclosure standing, but never has
foreclosure liability.” 16

MERS does not make mortgage loans. MERS does not take payment on mortgage

loans. No homeowner every promises to pay MERS any money. MERS does not receive the
proceeds of any foreclosure sale. MERS is not liable for the fraud or deceptive practices of
the lender. MERS is not the beneficiary of any mortgage note or security instrument.
Therefore, MERS is cannot assign, substitute trustee, declare default, or convey the
beneficial interest in property through a trustee’s deed.

In summary, Harris has stated a claim for relief for declaratory judgment that:

(1) The assignment of the beneficial interest to MERS in the Trust Deed is a nullity.

16

Id.

(2) The MERS executed and recorded SOT violates U.C.A. § 57-1-19 through § 57-122

Case 2:10-cv-00690-TC Document 25

Filed 10/08/10 Page 23 of 34

36.

(3) The MERS/Woodall NOD violates U.C.A. § 57-1-19 through § 57-1-36.

(4) And, thus, for the same reasons, the MERS/Woodall Trustee’s deed violates
U.C.A. § 57-1-19 through § 57-1-36.

Therefore, Plaintiff moves the Court to deny Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss when

Plaintiff has clearly stated a claim upon which relief can be granted.

B. Harris has properly stated, and pleaded, his claim for violations of the
FDCPA.
The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA”) forbids false or misleading

representations and unfair collection tactics, including threats to foreclose when not legally
entitled to do so. 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692d-1692f. The FDCPA requires that debt collectors give
consumers written validation and verification of a debt as well as the identity of the

creditor in order to prevent collection of debts or fees not actually owed. 15 U.S.C. §
1692g(a). The FDCPA grants a private right of action allowing consumers to sue for

statutory punitive damages, costs and attorney’s fees. 15 U.S.C. § 1692k(1). The FDCPA

must be construed broadly in favor of debtors, analyzed from the perspective of the “least
sophisticated debtor.” 17

MERS, and its appointed foreclosure attorneys, are third-party debt collector subject

to the FDCPA when they regularly collect, or attempt to collect, directly or indirectly, debts
17

See, e.g., Brown v. Card Service Center. 464 F.3d 450, 453 (“Because the FDCPA is a remedial statute, we
construe its language broadly, so as to effect its purpose. Accordingly, . . . we have held that certain
communications from lenders to debtors should be analyzed from the perspective of the “least sophisticated
debtor.”).

owed or due or asserted to be owed or due to another. Woodall is one of about a half-

dozen Utah attorneys who collectively institute the bulk of the thousands of non-judicial

foreclosures that occur every year in Utah. If the Court is not satisfied that the Complaint
properly pleaded the “regularity” contention as to Woodall (despite its references to the
frequency of the foreclosure activities of MERS and its appointed trustees (Plaintiff’s
Complaint, at ¶ 86)), Harris asks leave of the Court to do so by amendment.

By instituting foreclosure proceedings, MERS and its appointed foreclosure

attorneys are “attempt[ing] to collect, [either] directly or indirectly, debts” within the

meaning of the statute. 18 The overwhelming majority of state and federal courts have

concluded that bringing a foreclosure action is a debt collection activity governed by the
Act. 19

Moreover, whatever the mortgage closing documents say, because MERS, and its

appointed foreclosure attorneys like Woodall, remit all proceeds of their collection

activities to the actual owner of the loan, Woodall is clearly collecting a debt that is owed to
another business entity. MERS and Woodall are not creditors exempted under the statute
when they do not “offer or extend credit” on any mortgage loan. See 15 U.S.C. § 1692a(4).

The FDCPA contains an exemption specifically designed for mortgage servicers. See

15 U.S.C. § 1692a(6)(F). 20 However, this exemption does not apply to MERS or Woodall for
two reasons: (1) MERS and trustees are not mortgage loan servicers when they do not

service the debt by collecting payments due; (2) the legislative history and policy rationale
behind the exemption indicates MERS and its appointed foreclosure attorneys do not

qualify. Congress exempted original creditors and loan servicers (prior to default) from the
FDCPA because it felt that market forces would penalize creditors who perpetrated

overbearing or harassing debt collection practices when consumers could shift their future
credit purchases elsewhere; third-party debt collectors, on the other hand, are not chosen
by the consumer, and therefore are not vulnerable to a market-base remedy. Likewise,

homeowners never choose to interact with MERS, or foreclosure attorneys like Woodall.
Additionally, MERS’ and Woodall’s collection activities are focused exclusively and

completely on collecting loans on the eve of foreclosure. Therefore, because there is no

market-based remedy to penalize MERS or Woodall for unfair or deceptive debt collection

practices and because their collection activities are post-default, they should be considered

third-party debt collectors.

The FDCPA will be gutted if entities like MERS and its appointed foreclosure

attorneys are not considered debt collectors. If courts conclude MERS is entitled to

exemption, third-party debt collection mills will inevitably circumvent the statute by

instructing doctors, hospitals, landlords, credit card lenders, and others to list MERS, or
some other “obligee of record in nominee capacity” in the loan or account origination
documents. These “nominees” can then hire attorneys like Woodall, who demand

payments from homeowners for hundreds of thousands of dollars with only superficial
verification of the alleged debt, who then escape all liability under the FDCPA.

It is for this reason that the FDCPA must be construed broadly in favor of debtors.

Mortgage servicers, like Aurora, who cloak themselves in MERS’ name, should also be

considered debt collectors. MERS is a relatively small company without the resources to
use its own employees to bring the hundreds of thousands of foreclosures in which it is

named a party. 21 MERS solves this problem by telling courts, and anyone else who asks,

that the servicer’s employee or foreclosure attorney is an employee of MERS, even though
MERS does not pay that person a salary or any other compensation. 22 Under MERS’

company policy, thousands of employees of other companies and law firms have been

named “certifying officers” of MERS. 23 A servicer’s employee or foreclosure attorney can
become a “Vice-President” or “Assistant Secretary” of MERS by simply filling out the

“Corporate Resolution Request Form” on MERS’ web page. 24 Once a servicer’s employee or

foreclosure attorney attains the fictitious “Assistant Secretary” title, she can order as many

MERS corporate seals as she wishes for a fee of $25.

In this case, Woodall claims he was substituted as trustee on the authority of “Susan

Smothers, Assistant Secretary of MERS.” See Substitution of Trustee, supra. Susan

Smothers is most likely not a bona-fide employee of MERS, but rather is an employee of

Cal-Western Reconveyance, the foreclosure-services alter-ego of the law firm Pite Duncan

LLP. This is fundamentally deceptive. The FDCPA demands that courts look past the

nominal labels debt collectors give themselves and determine who is actually engaging in

what type of economic activity. Whether Aurora is the servicer or the purported assignee
of Harris’ mortgage, it should not be able to pretend to be someone else in order to start
foreclosure proceedings by authorizing Woodall to enter his appearance. If Aurora is in

A certifying officer is an employee of the Lender who is appointed a MERS officer by a MERS Corporate

Question: Does the title that the employee holds as an employee of the Lender correspond to the title
that the employee holds as a MERS Certifying Officer?
No. All MERS Certifying Officers are appointed assistant secretaries and vice presidents of Mortgage

Lender, that employee is not a Senior Vice President of MERS. The employee is an assistant secretary
and vice president of MERS.

fact the assignee of Harris’ mortgage, it should have, in compliance with Utah law, recorded
that assignment and then properly substituted in Woodall pursuant to its own lawful
authority under Title 57. Instead, Aurora hides behind the mask of MERS to start

foreclosure proceedings, confusing and deceiving homeowners like Harris who don’t know
where to turn to cure a default or negotiate a forbearance. Dean Peterson appropriately
describes MERS as the “masked executioner.” 25

Susan Smother’s MERS masquerade is per se deceptive, and Woodall is complicit in

her deception. Debt collectors who pretend to send letters from an attorney, where an
attorney has not actually reviewed the file in question, have committed a deceptive act

under the statute. Clomon v. Jackson, 988 F.2d 1314 (2d.Cir. 1993). Similarly, third-party

debt collectors cannot exempt themselves from the statute by pretending to be the

creditor. 15 U.S.C. § 1692e(11). And when a creditor pretends to be a third-party debt

collector, they lose their exemption under the statute. 26 The thousands of MERS’ “Vice-

Presidents” and “Assistant Secretaries” and the foreclosure attorneys, like Woodall, who
purport to act on MERS’ behalf, are in-fact third party debt collectors masquerading as
agents of the original creditor.

The prophylactic purposes of the FDCPA will be defeated by the MERS’ rationale,

whereby any original creditor can set up a “corporate resolution” form on its web site,
25

See Peterson, supra.
15 U.S.C. § 1692a(6) (“The term ‘debt collector’ . . . includes any creditor who, in the process of collecting his
own debts, uses any name other than his own which would indicate that a third person is collecting or attempting
to collect such debts, such term includes any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the
mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the enforcement of security interests.”).

enabling third-party debt collectors to fictitiously assign themselves officious titles with the
creditor. From the perspective of the least-sophisticated consumer, especially in the case
of a homeowner facing foreclosure, the representation that an “Assistant Secretary” of an

official-sounding organization like MERS is instituting foreclosure proceedings is

misleading and deceptive. The homeowner does not know with whom he or she should

attempt to negotiate a settlement, or where he or she should go to obtain information on

the amount due. The homeowner has no way to distinguish between the MERS “Assistant

Secretary” making foreclosure threats on his home and the myriad other mortgage-rescue
schemers and charlatans who prey on the vulnerable in the present housing market
downturn.

The representation that Susan Smothers is an employee of MERS is false when the

economic reality of the interaction indicates otherwise: the “employee” is not selected

through any hiring process and is not paid any salary or compensation. At minimum, the

representation that Susan Smothers is an employee of MERS is misleading when the leastsophisticated consumer is likely to believe that a company other than the lender has
intervened to prosecute the foreclosure when, in fact, no such thing has occurred.

Furthermore, for Woodall to claim in his NOD that MERS “has executed and

delivered to said Trustee a written declaration of default and a demand for sale, and has
deposited with said Trustee such deed and all documents evidencing the obligation
secured thereby” (emphasis added) is misleading, and most likely false, as will be

determined at trial. Harris claims that MERS does not have his Note, endorsed by Lehman

or in blank. If MERS does not have it, it was not delivered to Woodall, as he claims. Thus he
is unlawfully attempting to collect a debt pursuant to the FDCPA.

Even if this Court decides that Woodall is not a debt collector in his capacity as a

trustee for a secured mortgage obligation, he is a debt collector under the FDCPA when he
purports to act on the authority of Susan Smothers and MERS, when he knows, or should
have known, that she is not in fact a MERS employee and/or that MERS had no agency

relationship with the true holder of Harris’ note at the time Woodall recorded the NOD.

If Defendants can prove at trial that they have fully complied with the requirements

of Title 57, Harris stipulates that his claim to violations of the FDCPA fails as a matter of
law. However, as more fully developed supra, Harris has stated a claim that Woodall’s

appointment as trustee was unlawful and therefore his notice of default and subsequent
sale of Harris’ property through the trustee’s sale are unlawful. Contrary to Woodall’s

assertion in his brief that “Plaintiff does not allege that Woodall did anything outside of his
role as trustee under the Deed of Trust” (at p. 5), Harris claims that Woodall acted without
authority, that he was not in fact the trustee appointed in accordance with Title 57, and

that he therefore was illegally demanding payment on a Note he had no claim to and that he
unlawfully foreclosed upon the property. See Complaint at ¶¶ 53-54, 56-61.

The NOD recorded by Woodall violates Title 57. A substitution of trustee must “be

executed and acknowledged by all of the beneficiaries under the trust deed or their

Case 2:10-cv-00690-TC Document 25

successors in interest.” Id. If Woodall is acting at the behest of Aurora (or any other lender
by assignment), his SOT is per se illegal because of its failure to include the required

acknowledgment(s). At minimum, the SOT is not executed and acknowledged by Lehman
or by the purchasers of Lehman’s assets in bankruptcy.

Defendants’ claim that trustees are not debt collectors under the FDCPA by citing

Burnett. See Burnett, supra. Once again, their reliance on Burnett is unpersuasive. The

FDCPA claims in Burnett were dismissed by Judge Kimball because the plaintiff “merely
parrots the language of the [FDCPA] statute and does not meet the pleading standards

under Bell Atlantic v. Twombly, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (2007).” Burnett, at p. 5. Because Burnett
failed to allege specific acts of debt collection beyond “parroting the language” of the

statute, her claim was dismissed. Woodall once again misleads the Court in his brief when
he claims, “Plaintiff does not even allege that Woodall meets the definition of a “debt

collector” under 15 U.S.C. § 1691(a)(6).” Defendants Memorandum, at pp. 5-6. Harris’
Complaint alleges that “[t]hese thousands of MERS’ “Vice-Presidents” and the[ir]

foreclosure attorneys, like the Trustee in this case, who purport to act on MERS’ behalf, are
in-fact third party debt collectors masquerading as agents of the original creditor.” Id. at ¶
86.

Additionally, § 1691(a)(6) does not provide the only statutory definition for a “debt

collector:” “The term ‘debt collector’ . . . includes any creditor who, in the process of

collecting his own debts, uses any name other than his own which would indicate that a
31

third person is collecting or attempting to collect such debts, such term includes any

person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business
the principal purpose of which is the enforcement of security interests.” 15 U.S.C. §
1692a(6).

Harris’ Complaint does not merely parrot the statute. In his 30 paragraph, six-page

FDCPA Cause of Action, Harris makes numerous, specific, factual allegations as to how

MERS and Woodall are “debt collectors” acting in “connection with the collection of a debt.”
Additionally, the Complaint recites a variety of case law for the proposition that post-

default foreclosure activities are debt collection activities within the meaning of the FDCPA.
Moreover, based on this Court’s determination as to whether MERS is indeed the holder of
the “beneficial interest” in Harris’ mortgage and/or whether MERS was acting on behalf of

the true note-holder, Woodall’s appointment as trustee is invalid, his demand for payment
under the mortgage is an attempt to collect a debt that is not due (to him), and the

foreclosure sale he conducted is illegal. Burnett stands for the proposition, at best (because
it is dicta), that a trustee who, without any deception as to his identity or authority,

prosecutes a “non-judicial foreclosure does not act ‘in connection with the collection of [a]

debt’ when that trustee limits his or her conduct to the statutory requisites governing nonjudicial foreclosure.” Id. at p. 6.

Furthermore, Title 57 supports Harris’ demand that Woodall and/or MERS produce

the “blue-ink” note verifying and validating both the identity of the true note-holder and
32

Case 2:10-cv-00690-TC Document 25

Filed 10/08/10 Page 33 of 34

the amount of the debt. Woodall’s NOD declares that MERS has delivered to him “all
documents evidencing the obligation secured thereby.” Thus, it should be no great

inconvenience for Woodall to produce the Note as requested by Harris, given that it is the
primary document “evidencing the obligation.”

In sum, Harris has stated a claim for violations of the FDCPA by MERS, Woodall and

any unidentified lender who is instructing Woodall to act, when his appointment by MERS
was unlawful because MERS is not the beneficiary of the Trust Deed or, by assignment or

otherwise, and therefore lacked authority to appoint a substitute trustee under Utah law.

Furthermore, Defendants have violated the FDCPA by using “deceptive forms” which mask
the true identity of the creditor to whom the debt was owed. As a result of Defendants’

violations of Title 57 and the FDCPA, Harris was confused, pacified, unable to identify the
party with whom he could negotiate any forbearance, and he therefore lost his home.

Plaintiff therefore respectfully moves this Court to deny Defendants’ motion to

dismiss.

Dated this 8th day of October 2010.
