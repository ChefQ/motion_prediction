Defendants.

Judge: Campbell

Plaintiff Richard W. Harris (“Harris”) respectfully submits the following Memorandum
of Points and Authorities in Opposition to Defendants’ Lehman Brothers Bank FSB
(“Lehman”), Aurora Loan Services, LLC (“Aurora”) and Mortgage Electronic Registration
Systems, Inc. (“MERS”) Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint.

SUMMARY OF DEFENDANT’S ARGUMENT
Defendants begin by attacking Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint under the guise of “if you
don’t have the law, argue the facts, and if you don’t have the facts, attack your opponent,”
and that Plaintiff’s original and amended Complaints and the November 4, 2010 Request
for Judicial Notice are “irrelevant” and “do not apply to this case.” See Defendant’s
Memorandum, at p. 1-2.
Defendants then make three arguments in support of their revised Motion to
Dismiss: (1) MERS is “a beneficiary under the trust deed” and is “able to enforce the terms
of the Note and Trust Deed; and (2) non-judicial foreclosure is a contract-right and thus
Plaintiff’s “wrong beneficiary” argument is irrelevant; (3) the FDCPA does not apply.
Plaintiff will address the first two arguments and but will not address the third, as
the Amended Complaint redacts the FDCPA cause of action of thus the issue is moot.
ARGUMENT
I.

MERS is not the Beneficiary of Harris’s Trust Deed and has absolutely no
ability to enforce, or to even claim enforcement, of the underlying
mortgage promissory Note.

The privilege of non-judicial foreclosure permits a secured party to foreclose the
beneficial interest in a mortgage deed outside of the scrutiny and supervision of the court
system as long as that party complies with the strict requirements of the state’s nonjudicial foreclosure statute, U.C.A. §§ 57-1-19 - § 57-1-38. See Preliminary Injunction
Memorandum and Order, Case No. 1009163364-UT (Nov. 1, 2010) (unpublished decision),

attached as Exhibit 1. While this Court may certainly interpret the state non-judicial
foreclosure statute to evaluate whether Plaintiff has stated a claim upon which relief can be
granted, the Court should be persuaded, at least under the minimum-threshold Rule
12(b)(6) standard, that Plaintiff has stated a claim upon which relief can be granted when a
state court, interpreting the state’s non-judicial foreclosure statute, not only held that the
homeowner’s claim for declaratory judgment stated a claim upon which relief could be
granted but that “Plaintiff’s claim for declaratory judgment that Defendants MERS, [and the
successors in interest by substitution/assignment from MERS], lack proper authority,
pursuant to U.C.A. §§ 57-1-19 -- § 57-1-38 present serious issues on the merits which
should be the subject of further litigation.” See id.
Furthermore, the Third District Court concluded that “the injunction is not adverse to
the public interest when the home-owning public is protected by strict enforcement of
Utah’s non-judicial foreclosure statute . . . which requires that only the beneficiary of record
to a trust deed may exercise the power of non-judicial power of sale (emphasis supplied).
See id. This holding legitimates Plaintiff’s claim against MERS and Aurora when the
Assignment of the beneficial interest in the Trust Deed was neither executed nor recorded
until weeks after the Trustee’s Deed which purportedly terminated Plaintiff’s interest in
the Property.
II.

Non-Judicial Foreclosure is not a purely-contractual right, as alleged by
Defendants, but is governed by Utah’s Trust Deed Statute, which clearly
defines the rights, roles and responsibilities of the secured parties to the
non-judicial foreclosure procedure.

As Defendants admit in their Memorandum, U.C.A. § 57-1-19 defines “Beneficiary” as
“the person named or otherwise designated in a trust deed as the person for whose benefit
a trust deed is given, or his successor in interest (emphasis supplied).” See id at p.2.
According to the plain language of the statutory definition, “Beneficiary” is singular, it is the
person named . . . for whose benefit a trust deed is given. Additionally, under Title 57’s
provision for reconveying a trust deed, a “’[b]enficiary’ means the record owner of the
beneficiary’s interest under a trust deed, including successors in interest (emphasis
supplied). See id. at § 57-1-39 (2006). Lastly, the same provision defines a “[m]ortgagee”
as “the record owner of the mortgagee’s interest under a mortgage, including a successor
in interest (emphasis supplied). See id.
The public policy underlying the exercise of the privilege of non-judicial foreclosure is
contravened when the chain of title to real property is obfuscated by multiple parties
making ambiguous, arbitrary and contradictory claims to the same interest in real
property. Plaintiff’s Trust Deed consistently refers to the secured rights of the Lender
(Lehman) in the Property, and both the non-judicial foreclosure statute and the Trust Deed
permit only the Lender the power to substitute trustee, for example. The case at bar is a
perfect example of the transparency required by the system of public records maintained
by an elected County Recorder before the non-judicial foreclosure privilege can be
exercised, when Plaintiff’s original Lender Lehman failed under the weight of its predatory
sub-prime lending portfolio prior to the institution of the foreclosure proceedings. As

4

Case 2:10-cv-00690-TC Document 32

alleged in the Complaint, Lehman sold off its various assets through bankruptcy. Then on
August 14, 2009, Cal-Western Reconveyance, a foreign foreclosure process servicing
company executed and recorded documents in MERS’ name as Beneficiary, not nominee,
not legal title holder, nor in any other limited agent capacity for Lehman or its successor(s) in
interest. See SOT, NOD, Assignment and Trustee’s Deed, attached as Exhibits 2-5.
While MERS may, arguendo, be permitted to act in a limited nominee/agent capacity at
the specific instruction of an original Lender, it may not fully supplant a
bankrupt/dissolved/non-existent Lender and prosecute a foreclosure in its own name, as it
has done in Plaintiff’s case. All the recorded documents abstracted to the title of Plaintiff’s
Property claim MERS is “the Beneficiary.” See SOT, NOD, Assignment and Trustee’s Deed,
supra.
The Notice of Default is the clearest indication of the illegality of Defendants’ exercise of
the privilege of non-judicial foreclosure when it claims “the beneficial interest under such
Deed of Trust and the obligations secured thereby are presently owned by MORTGAGE
ELECTRONIC REGISTRATION SYSTEMS, INC. (emphasis supplied).” Id. MERS Membership
Rules unequivocally preclude any MERS’ Member from every claiming any ownership
interest in the underlying debt obligation, the mortgage promissory note. See MERS
Membership Rules June 2009, at p. 26 (“The Member shall not plead MERS as the noteowner

in

any

foreclosure

document”)

Not only do MERS’ own membership rules preclude note-ownership claims as in the
present case, but MERS itself admits it is not the beneficiary to any trust deed: in a
September 2009 deposition, MERSCORP, Inc. (the parent-company of MERS) President R.K.
Arnold admitted that his company does not have a beneficial interest in any mortgage; that
it does not loan money; and that it does not suffer a default if a borrower fails to repay a
mortgage loan.1
Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice that the nation’s largest mortgage lending
institutions have admitted to falsely claiming, under oath, in tens of thousands of
foreclosure proceedings across the country, that they physically possess the negotiable
instrument entitling them to exercise the security interest in a mortgage trust deed or lien
presents a prima facie case in support of Plaintiff’s claim that the foreclosure-related
documents recorded and abstracted to the title of his Property should be suspect given
Lehman’s bankruptcy and given MERS’ sua sponte efforts to foreclose in its own name.
Defendants argue that Plaintiff consented to any and all actions taken by MERS on
behalf on the Lender when the adhesive and contradictory language of the Trust Deed
declares that ‘“MERS” is the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. MERS is a
separate corporation that is acting solely as nominee for Lender and Lender’s successors
and assigns.

MERS is the beneficiary under this security instrument (emphasis

original).” See Trust Deed, attached as Exhibit 6. The term “nominee” is nowhere defined

within the Trust Deed, while every other key term is defined (eg. Security Instrument,
Borrower, Lender, Trustee, Note, Property, Loan, Riders, etc.). See id, at Definitions.
Not only does MERS make the simultaneous and schizophrenic claim to be the agent
(“nominee”) and principal (“beneficiary”) of the same secured interest in Harris’ Property,
but it then shifts position once again in ¶ R of the Trust Deed by claiming to hold legal title
to the Property: “Borrower understands and agrees that MERS holds legal title only to the
interests granted by Borrower in this security instrument, but, if necessary to comply with
law or custom, MERS (as nominee . . .) has the right to [exercise any and all interests to
foreclose and sell the property]. See id.
MERS cannot possibly hold legal title to the Trust Property at the time of the execution
of the Trust Deed because, as the Trust Deed clearly indicates, legal title is held by the
Trustee, ITS Title. See id. at ¶ (D); see also U.C.A. § 57-1-20 (“[a]ll right, title, interest and
claim in and to the trust property acquired by the trustor . . . shall inure to the trustee as
security for the obligation”); see also Trust Deed, supra at ¶ R (“Borrower irrevocablely
grants, conveys and warrants to Trustee, in trust, with power of sale, the following
described property . . .”).
Defendants like Aurora, Lehman and Bank of America invented MERS in order to lower
transaction costs for the bundling and pooling of mortgage-backed assets into
collateralized-debt-obligations (CDO’s).

These securitization parties did so in

contravention of hundreds of years of law and tradition, beginning in 1636 when the

7

Case 2:10-cv-00690-TC Document 32

Plymouth Bay Colony enacted its first Recording Act, requiring that “all sales exchanges
fites of mortgages leases or other Conveyances or howses and lands the sale to be
acknowledged before the Governor or any one of the Assistants and committed to the
public record.2 When sub-prime lending became popularized in the late 1990s, the nation’s
large mortgage lending institutions established MERS to facilitate the securitization of
subprime mortgages, creating a conduit for structured predatory finance which devastated,
in just a few years, the democratic tradition of a transparent system of public records for
ownership in real property. As a result, homeowners like Harris cannot know who in fact
owns their mortgage or with whom he or she should negotiate a forbearance or
modification. Not only is a homeowner’s ability to mitigate damages or to request and/or
receive modification and forbearance intentionally circumvented by the MERS
masquerade, but there is a real possibility of double-recovery against borrowers like
Harris, as the facts of the Amended Complaint clearly demonstrate: As of October 15, 2010,
MERSCorp’s Servicer ID systems declares that Aurora is merely the “Servicer” of Harris’
loan and the “Bank of America, N.A.” (“BAC”) is the purported “investor” which presumably
owns his mortgage as trustee/certificate holder for a CDO. See MERS Loan ID, attached as
Exhibit 7.
Since 2007 when the housing market began to decline and many of MERS’ original
founding members failed, dissolved or entered bankruptcy, 6.6 million foreclosures have

been initiated.3 However, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 12 million foreclosures will
be commenced within the next five years, largely because more than half of all subprime
mortgages originated since 2006 will end in foreclosure. One of the most remarkable facts
about the sub-prime lending movement pushed by the nation’s largest banks and Wall
Street brokerage houses is that it was undisputedly predatory: 61% of borrowers who
received subprime loans in 2006 qualified for prime loans with better and more affordable
credit terms.4 For the judicial system and the home-owning public at large, the most
troubling foundational element of the continuing nationwide foreclosure crisis is that
approximately 60% of the nation’s residential mortgages or “owned” and tracked in MERS’
private database, and according to MERSCorp CEO R.K. Arnold, MERS’ stated goal is to
“capture every mortgage loan in the country.”5
Federal trial courts in this state have been understandably hesitant to grant relief to
homeowners who find themselves have difficulty making their mortgage payments based
on the defense of simple allegations of MERS’s involvement in a non-judicial foreclosure
proceeding. Many of this Court’s decisions granting mortgage-lending Defendants’ Motions
to Dismiss have been prosecuted by pro se Complainants, or have been poorly plead by
attorneys and firms who have created a cottage-industry of submitting cut-and-paste
MERS/Securitization Complaints which are devoid of either the specific factual detail of the

borrower’s transaction or the foreclosure-related documents abstracted to title in
reference to the requirements of the non-judicial foreclosure statute.
Harris’ Amended Complaint is not devoid of the requisite factual detail and he has
stated a claim for relief not only on the basis of Judge Toomey’s recent persuasive statecourt interpretation of the Trust Deed statute, but based also in reliance, as developed in
the Amended Complaint, on the in-depth appellate analyses performed by the state
Supreme Courts of Maine, Nebraska, Kansas, and Arkansas, in addition to an appellate court
decision in Missouri.6
Therefore, Harris respectfully requests that this Court deny Defendants’ Motion to
Dismiss his Amended Complaint when the plain language of Utah’s non-judicial foreclosure
statute and a recent persuasive interpretation of the law provide a basis upon which
declaratory relief can be granted.
