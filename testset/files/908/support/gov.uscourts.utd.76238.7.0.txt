INTRODUCTION
Harris’s property was foreclosed on. Yet in challenging the foreclosure, he does not
allege that he had tendered payments, or had the ability to tender payments, or had encountered
confusion in seeking to tender payments due under a loan secured by a Deed of Trust on real
property located in Riverton, Utah. Instead, Harris seeks a Court decree deeming a Deed of Trust

attached to his Complaint void.
His basis for this extraordinary relief is the contention that neither the Lender, nor the
beneficiary, nor any assignee of the beneficiary under the Deed of Trust have the authority to
initiate nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings under the Deed of Trust. Plaintiff apparently
premises his contention on a theory that the loan at issue was securitized by the original lender,
that no assignment appears in the official records of the County to confirm the transfer of
ownership to the securitization, and that the named Defendants allegedly do not have possession
of the promissory note. Through the haze of his pleading, he appears to allege that while MERS
had the authority to foreclose on his home if Lehman, the original Lender held the Deed of Trust,
once Lehman sold its interest, MERS ability to foreclose on his home was extinguished.
Plaintiff’s theory is fundamentally flawed both under the Deed of Trust and applicable
case law. Under the terms of the Deed of Trust, MERS, the beneficiary of the deed of trust as
nominee for the Lender owner and its successors and assigns, has the authority under Utah law
and the terms of the deed of trust at issue to declare a default in payment or proceed with
nonjudicial foreclosure.
In two cases, the Court recognized the authority of MERS as a beneficiary under the
Deed of Trust to proceed with nonjudicial foreclosure based upon a deed of trust with identical

terms to the loan at issue.1 As a result, as a matter of law, Plaintiff cannot state his First through
Fourth Causes of Action for Declaratory Judgment that MERS Lacks Standing, Violation of the
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Quiet Title, and Equitable Relief. As a result, the Court
should dismiss each of Plaintiff’s causes of action for failure to state a claim upon which relief
can be granted.

I.

ALLEGED FACTS
On October 19, 2006, Plaintiff entered into a mortgage loan for $513,907.00, for a home

in Riverton, Utah.2 The home loan originated with Defendant Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB
(“Lehman”) as the “Lender”3 In conjunction with the loan, Plaintiff signed a promissory note
and trust deed. The trust deed identified Lehman as the “Lender,” Plaintiff as the “Borrower,”
Equity Title as “Trustee,” and Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (“MERS”), as
nominee for the lender Lehman and its successors and assigns, and the successors and assigns of
MERS.4
The Trust Deed states that MERS is the nominee for Lender and Lender’s successors and
assigns for purposes of foreclosing and selling the Property:
Borrower understands and agrees that MERS holds only legal title to the interest
granted by Borrower in this Security Instrument, but if necessary to comply with
law or custom, MERS (as nominee for Lender and Lender’s successors and
assigns) has the right: to exercise any or all of those interests, including, but not

limited to, the right to foreclose and sell the Property; and to take any action
required of Lender including, but not limited to, releasing and canceling this
Security Instrument.5
Due to a default in payments, MERS, as beneficiary under the Deed of Trust,
appointed Defendant James H. Woodall as successor trustee under the Deed of Trust. On
April 3, 2007, Woodall recorded a Notice of Default with the Salt Lake County Recorder,
commencing a nonjudicial foreclosure, entry number 10780109.6
Aurora Loan Services, LLC purchased the property on April 28, 2010.7 From
these facts, Plaintiff alleges four causes of action against Defendants: (1) Declaratory
Judgment that MERS Lacks Standing, (2) Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act, (3) Quiet Title, and (4) Equitable Relief. These four causes of action have no basis
in fact or in law.

ARGUMENT
I.

STANDARD OF REVIEW.
A motion to dismiss should be granted pursuant to F.R.C.P. 12(b)(6) if the plaintiff is

unable show sufficient facts to set forth a plausible claim for relief.8 As the Supreme Court
explained in Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, Harris’ Complaint need not contain detailed factual
allegations, but it must plead “enough facts to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its

face.”9 And those allegations must be sufficient to create more than a speculative right to relief –
a claim is plausible on its face “when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to
draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”10
Here, Harris must be required to frame a complaint with enough “factual matter” to show
that he is entitled to relief against Defendants and to “nudge [his] claims across the line from
conceivable to plausible.”11 The policy behind this plausibility standard is to expose defects in a
case early in the process, “at the point of minimum expenditure of time and money by the parties
and the court.”12

On the face of the Complaint, the defects in Harris’ Complaint are apparent:

as his Complaint rests on a specious theory – one that is belied by the Deed of Trust and one that
has already been debunked in this Court and in courts across the country.

II.

HARRIS’ “MORTGAGE PROTESTER” ARGUMENTS ARE SPECIOUS AND ROUTINELY
REJECTED.
Harris’ underlying argument for his Complaint is that that neither MERS nor Lehman or

any of their agents or assigns have the authority to assert any default on the Note, or power of
sale under the Deed of Trust because they have securitized the Note. As illustrated by the very
documents upon which Harris relies in his Complaint, and Plaintiff’s own contradictory
assertions, this central argument lacks merit and has been discredited in this District Court.

MERS Has Authority to Commence Nonjudicial Foreclosure as the
Beneficiary under the Deed of Trust.

Plaintiff’s Complaint is full of vague allegations about MERS. Yet while Plaintiff does
not allege any facts or theories regarding how this information is relevant to his causes of action,
Plaintiff makes these allegations purportedly to challenge the securitization of the underlying
Note to the Deed of Trust. Reading between the lines of Plaintiff’s Complaint, it appears he is
complaining that when the Lender, Lehman, securitizes or sells the Note, that cuts off the ability
of MERS to enforce the terms of the Deed of Trust.
But Plaintiff understood and explicitly agreed in the Deed of Trust that MERS was the
beneficiary and had the authority to foreclose as the nominee for Lehman and for Lehman’s
successors and assigns:
The Beneficiary of this Security Instrument is MERS (solely as nominee for
Lender and Lender’s successors and assigns….

Borrower understands and agrees that MERS holds only legal title to the interest
granted by Borrower in this Security Instrument, but if necessary to comply with
law or custom, MERS (as nominee for Lender and Lender’s successors and
assigns) has the right: to exercise any or all of those interests, including, but
not limited to, the right to foreclose and sell the Property; and to take any
action required of Lender including, but not limited to, releasing and canceling
this Security Instrument.13
Thus, under the terms of the Deed of Trust, not only is it apparent that MERS is the beneficiary
of the Deed of Trust, but that MERS has the authority as the nominee for Lender and Lender’s
successors and assigns to foreclose and sell the property or otherwise enforce the terms of the
Deed of Trust.

Complaint, Exhibit 2, p. 3 (emphasis added).

The fact that the Lender may have sold its interest in the Note (as vaguely alleged in
Plaintiff’s Complaint) is immaterial to MERS’s authority to foreclose and sell the property if
there has been a default – it was contemplated and agreed to by the parties in the Deed of Trust.
The Deed of Trust, which Plaintiff signed and agreed to, contemplates that the Note could be
assigned and transferred multiple times. For that purpose, the Trust Deed specifically states that,
“The Note or a partial interest in the Note (together with this Security Instrument) can be sold
one or more times without prior notice to Borrower.”14 Securitizations of the loans is neither a
fact concealed from borrowers like the Plaintiff nor one that deprives the named Defendants
from having the power to proceed with a nonjudicial foreclosure upon the Plaintiff’s default in
payments.
The Court has already dismissed Plaintiff’s theory. In Burnett v. Mortgage Electronic
Registration Systems, Inc.,15 Judge Kimball held that such language in a trust deed validly
confers on MERS authority to foreclose on property on behalf of a lender. In that case, similar
to here, the plaintiff, a borrower who had defaulted under the trust deed, alleged in her complaint
that MERS did not have authority to initiate foreclosure proceedings and appoint a successor
trustee.16 The Court disagreed, concluding that “when Plaintiff defaulted on her contractual
monthly payments, MERS had authority under the Deed of Trust to initiate foreclosure
proceedings and to appoint [the] successor trustee. Upon Burnett’s default in payments, the

Court found that MERS had authority to “take any action” required of Lender, including the
right to appointed Woodall trustee and the right to foreclose and sell the property.”17
In dismissing the plaintiffs request for declaratory judgment, which was also based the
assumption that MERS lacked the authority to foreclose, the Court held that “the language of the
Deed of Trust clearly grants MERS the authority to exercise the full ambit of authority possessed
by the Lender.”18 “MERS had authority under the Deed of Trust to initiate foreclosure
proceedings and to appoint Woodall as successor trustee.” 19 Accordingly, the Court dismissed
Burnett’s Complaint in its entirety.20
Relying on the holdings of Burnett, in Rodeback v. Utah Financial,21 the Court again
dismissed Plaintiff’s theory on a motion to dismiss. There, Chief District Judge Campbell cited
to the Court’s holding in Burnett to find that while Plaintiffs may have alleged that the
underlying note was split from the trust deed, the trust deed specified that “‘MERS ... has the
right to exercise any or all of [the interests granted by the Borrower through the trust deed],
including, but not limited to, the right to foreclose and sell the Property; and to take any action
required of the Lender, including, but not limited to, releasing and canceling this Security
Instrument.’”22

In examining the same language regarding the authority of MERS found in the Deed of
Trust as is found here, the Court has previously decided in both Burnett and Rodeback that
MERS has the authority, even if the Note has been securitized or sold, to foreclose and sell the
property. Given these previous judicial holdings, Plaintiff’s Complaint should be dismissed in
its entirety as a matter of law.

B.

Plaintiff Fails to State a Claim for Declaratory Judgment that MERS Lacks
Standing

Plaintiff agreed in the Deed of Trust that MERS could act as the nominee for Lehman and
Lehman’s successors and assigns. The Deed of Trust also plainly contemplated that the Note
could be sold to third parties. Yet Plaintiff wants the Court to disregard the plain terms of the
Deed of Trust and substitute them with the more slippery “economic reality” of the mortgage
transaction (whatever that means).23
As explained above, Plaintiff’s theory is implausible. The Deed of Trust transferred to
MERS “the right to foreclose and sell the Property” and “take any action required of Lender.”24
The alleged transfer and securitization of the Note did not strip MERS of the right to foreclose
under the trust deed when Plaintiff defaults Therefore, Plaintiff’s generalized statements as to
the lack of authority of MERS to initiate foreclosure proceedings are not sufficient to warrant
declaratory relief.

Plaintiff’s Claim for Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act Fails.

Plaintiff’s argument that MERS is a debt collector is flawed and, again, relies upon its
discredited theory that MERS lacks authority under the Deed of Trust to commence a nonjudicial
foreclosure. As explained above, this theory is not plausible.
As a threshold matter, the FDCPA applies only to a debt collector who engages in
practices prohibited by the Act in an attempt to collect a consumer debt.25 Putting aside the issue
of whether or not MERS is a “debt collector” under the Act, it is clear that commencing a nonjudicial foreclosure is not the collection of a debt. In Kee v. R-G Crown Bank, the Court
recently found that “[a] non-judicial foreclosure is not the collection of a debt under the
FDCPA.”26 Similarly, the Court in Burnett found that, “A trustee engaged to effectuate a nonjudicial foreclosure does not act ‘in connection with the collection of [a] debt’ when that trustee
limits his or her conduct to the statutory requisites governing non-judicial foreclosure.”27 In
Maynard v. Cannon, this Court found that a substituted trustee under a deed of trust retained to
pursue a non-judicial foreclosure did not fall within the definition of a debt collector.28

In this case, the Deed of Trust granted MERS and its assigns the authority to enforce the
terms of the Deed of Trust. Plaintiff does not allege any plausible facts to the effect that MERS
or Woodall exceeded the statutory requisites in conducting the non-judicial foreclosure. Just as
in Kee, Maynard, and Burnett, Plaintiff’s claim should be dismissed as a matter of law.
D.

Plaintiff’s Claim for Quiet Title Fails.

Under Utah law, A quiet title action “is a suit brought ‘to quiet an existing title against an
adverse or hostile claim of another’ and ‘the effect of a decree quieting title is not to vest title but
rather is to perfect an existing title as against other claimants.’”29 “‘To succeed in an action to
quiet title to real estate, a plaintiff must prevail on the strength of his own claim to title and not
the weakness of a defendant’s title or even its total lack of title.’”30 Here, Plaintiff alleges no
facts either demonstrating the strength of his own title or that he is not in default. Instead,
Plaintiff alleges unsupported, conclusory, and self-serving contentions based on discredited legal
theories throughout the Complaint attempting to show alleged weakness in the interests of MERS
and Aurora. As shown above, he cannot prevail on the quiet title cause of action as a matter of
law.
E.

Plaintiff’s Claim for Equitable Relief Fails.

Plaintiff wants the Court to rewrite his loan, after he has defaulted on it. He requests that
the Court reform Plaintiff’s mortgage contract by ordering a reduction in principal and an

affordable fixed rate for the life of the loan. Yet Harris has not, and cannot allege any facts
giving rise to this extraordinary relief.
His sole complaint is that MERS does not have the authority to enforce the terms of the
Deed of Trust if the underlying Note is securitized or sold to a third party. But the Deed of Trust
is clear that MERS does have the authority, as its authority arises as the nominee of both the
Lender and the Lender’s successors and assigns. Accordingly, the requested relief has no
bearing on any of Plaintiff’s alleged facts.
