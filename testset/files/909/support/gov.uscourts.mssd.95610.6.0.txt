SHERIFF BILLIE SOLLIE

RESPONDENT

MOTION TO DISMISS

COMES NOW the respondent in the above referenced cause and respectfully
moves this Court to dismiss the instant Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus,1 and in
support thereof would show unto the Court the following:
I.
Petitioner Leroy Lewis has filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus challenging
his pretrial detention in the Lauderdale County Detention Center. Although Lewis does
not list the charges on his petition, the Lauderdale County Circuit Court confirmed that
Lewis is currently charged with murder, aggravated assault and simple assault on a law
enforcement officer. Lewis states that he has been incarcerated over a year on these
charges. ECF Doc 1. In his petition, Lewis does not request that he be brought to trial on
1

Respondent notes that Rule 4 of the Rules Governing §2254 Cases allows for a response
other than a formal answer, as described in Rule 5, and explicitly states that, if the judge does not
preliminarily dismiss the petition, “the judge must order the respondent to file an answer,
motion, or other response within a fixed time.” (Emphasis added). Further, the Rule 4 Advisory
Committee Notes acknowledge that “Rule 4 authorizes the judge to ‘take such other action as the
judge deems appropriate.’” In addition, the Committee Notes specifically address the filing of a
“motion to dismiss.” As such, respondent files the instant motion to dismiss Lewis’s petition.

the charges at issue. To the contrary, petitioner requests that he be released immediately
from custody “before I’m denied further constitutional rights in which I’m due as a
citizen of the United States of America,” and he seeks punitive damages in the amount of
2.5 million dollars. Id.
II.
According to information provided by the Lauderdale County Circuit Court
Clerk’s Office, Lewis was indicted on March 25, 2015, for murder/manslaughter (Count
I) and aggravated assault/simple assault (Count III) in Cause No. 161-15. See Exhibit A.
Trial on these charges was originally set for May 27, 2015 (see Exhibit B), but was reset
to July 28, 2015, as a result of the defense attorney’s motion to withdraw. See Exhibit C.
Additional continuances were granted for plea negotiations and an emergency with the
trial judge, as well as another trial setting. See Exhibit D. On October 20, 2015, the State
moved to amend the indictment to charge Lewis as an habitual offender (see Exhibit E),
and that motion was granted by Order filed October 26, 2015. See Exhibit F. Additional
continuances were granted because the prosecuting attorney was on military leave and for
“state request and Judge Williamson trying State v. Dunn and Moffitte.” See Exhibit G.
By Order filed March 3, 2016, on an ore tenus motion, new counsel was allowed to
substitute as counsel for Lewis, and his former counsel was relieved of any duties in the
case. See Exhibit H. Thereafter, the case was reset for June 1, 2016. See Exhibit I. A
continuance was granted for other pending trials and, thereafter, the matter was set for

2

October 31, 2016, with the reason stated as “Defendant seeks a trial and demands a
speedy trial.” See Exhibit J.
However, despite Lewis’s demand for speedy trial, counsel for defense filed a
motion for psychiatric examination in September 2016, which was also signed by Lewis.
See Exhibit K. By Order filed September 26, 2016, the trial court granted the
defendant’s motion, removed the case from its current trial setting and continued the
proceedings in the case until a report was received on the mental evaluation. See Exhibit
L. The court’s order, which was signed by Lewis and his counsel, clearly stated that
“Defendant’s assertion of a “speedy trial issue” shall be waived from the date of this
order until such time that this Court completes a competency hearing.” Id. (emphasis
supplied). A separate order was entered resetting the matter for March 20, 2017, based on
the order granting the defendant’s request for a mental evaluation. See Exhibit M.
Court records reflect that the mental examination was completed and the results
filed in January 2017, and by Order filed March 20, 2017, the trial court found Lewis
competent to stand trial following a hearing. See Exhibit N. Because of the hearing on
Lewis’s competence, the trial was reset for May 15, 2017, with a notation on the Order
granting a continuance that “no further continuances to be granted to Defendant.” See
Exhibit O. The trial court also entered an order on May 3, 2017, rejecting defendant’s ore
tenus motion to permit him to have additional counsel to represent him in this case
because defendant failed to provide any justification for his request to choose which

3

public defender he wished to have assigned to his case. See Exhibit P. Thereafter, an
additional continuance was granted by Order filed May 15, 2017, with the notation that
“defendant seeks a speedy trial.” See Exhibit Q. The case is currently set for September
11, 2017, with the continuance granted to the State to locate a necessary witness for trial.
See Exhibit R.
A second indictment was filed on January 27, 2016 for simple assault on a law
enforcement officer in Cause No. 063-16. See Exhibit S. Trial in that matter was
originally scheduled for April 2016 (see Exhibit T) but was continued for plea
negotiations and the pending case in Cause No. 161-15 and reset for June 1, 2016. See
Exhibit U. The case was reset for the reasons discussed above with regard to Cause No.
161-15, which included the defense’s request for a psychiatric evaluation (see Exhibit V),
and the matter is also currently set for trial on September 11, 2017. See Exhibit W.
III.
Because Lewis is a “pre-trial detainee,” the instant petition is considered pursuant to
28 U.S.C. § 2241. In Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Kentucky, 410 U.S. 484, 93
S.Ct. 1123 (1973), the United States Supreme Court held that a pre-trial detainee has a right
to seek federal habeas relief. Id., 410 U.S. at 488-89. The Braden Court reiterated, however,
“federal habeas corpus does not lie, absent ‘special circumstances,’ to adjudicate the merits
of an affirmative defense to a state criminal charge prior to a judgment of conviction by a
state court.” Id. at 489. The Court also stated that a petitioner is not permitted to derail “a

4

pending state proceeding by an attempt to litigate constitutional defenses prematurely in
federal court.” Id. at 493. Further, there is “an important distinction between a petitioner
who seeks to ‘abort a state proceeding or to disrupt the orderly functioning of state judicial
processes’ by litigating a speedy trial defense to a prosecution prior to trial, and one who
seeks only to enforce the state’s obligation to bring him promptly to trial.” Brown v. Estelle,
530 F.2d at 1280, 1283 (5th Cir. 1976). Generally, there are two types of relief sought by a
prisoner who asserts a pretrial habeas corpus petition:
[A]n attempt to dismiss an indictment or otherwise prevent a
prosecution is of the first type, while an attempt to force the
state to go to trial is of the second. While the former objective
is normally not attainable through federal habeas corpus, the
latter is, although the requirement of exhaustion of state
remedies still must be met.
Id. (emphasis added). “In other words, a federal court may generally consider a habeas
petition for pretrial relief from a state court only when the accused does not seek a dismissal
of the state court charges pending against him.” Greer v. St. Tammany Parish Jail, 693 F.
Supp. 502, 508 (E.D. La. 1988).
As noted above, absent from petitioner’s arguments in the instant petition is a request
to be brought to trial on the charges at issue or any other constitutional basis for federal
habeas relief. If this Court construes petitioner’s arguments as an attempt to prevent the
prosecution of his case, then he is seeking to “abort a state proceeding or to disrupt the
orderly functioning of state judicial processes.” Brown, 530 F.2d at 1282-83; Braden, 410
U.S. at 489. Respondent submits that Lewis’s attempt to dismiss the charges is not an
5

available remedy based on the allegations of the instant petition, absent “special
circumstances.” See Dickerson v. State, 816 F.2d 220, 227 (5th Cir. 1987) (citations omitted).
In the instant petition, Lewis does not specifically argue “special circumstances” to warrant
disruption of the state’s judicial process. Therefore, Respondent submits the instant petition
should be dismissed with prejudice for failure to state a claim upon which habeas relief may
be granted.
IV.
Moreover, if this Court construes Lewis’s arguments to request that he be brought to
trial, respondent submits that Lewis is not entitled to relief on that claim at this juncture.
In Braden, supra, the Supreme Court held that the defendant was entitled to raise his speedy
trial claim through a federal habeas petition because he had adequately exhausted his claim,
stating:
He has made repeated demands for trial to the courts of
Kentucky, offering those courts an opportunity to consider on
the merits his constitutional claim of the present denial of a
speedy trial. Under these circumstances it is clear that he has
exhausted all available state court remedies for consideration
of that constitutional claim, even though Kentucky has not yet
brought him to trial.

See Braden, 410 U.S. at 490. The Fifth Circuit has also acknowledged this exhaustion
requirement noting,

6

Despite the absence of an exhaustion requirement in the
statutory language of section 2241(c)(3), a body of case law has
developed holding that although section 2241 establishes
jurisdiction in the federal courts to consider pre-trial habeas
corpus petitions, federal courts should abstain from the exercise
of that jurisdiction if the issues raised in the petition may be
resolved either by trial on the merits in the state court or by
other state procedures available to the petitioner. See, e.g.,
Braden, 410 U.S. at 489-92, 93 S.Ct. at 1126-28; Ex parte
Royall, 117 U.S. 241, 250-54, 6 S.Ct. 734, 739-41, 29 L.Ed.
868, 871-72 (1886); Brown v. Estelle, 530 F.2d 1280, 1283 (5th
Cir.1976). See also Atkins v. Michigan, 644 F.2d 543, 546 (6th
Cir.), cert. denied, 452 U.S. 964, 101 S.Ct. 3115, 69 L.Ed.2d
975 (1981); Neville v. Cavanagh, 611 F.2d 673, 675 (7th
Cir.1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 908, 100 S.Ct. 1834, 64
L.Ed.2d 260 (1980); Moore v. DeYoung, 515 F.2d 437, 442 (3rd
Cir.1975).
Dickerson v. State, 816 F.2d at 225 (emphasis added).
The trial judge is clearly aware of Lewis’ recent request for speedy trial in May 2017,
and the case is set for trial in September 2017. Lewis may raise his speedy trial concerns
outlined in the instant federal habeas action by motion in the circuit court as allowed by state
law. If his challenge is unsuccessful and Lewis is convicted, he may pursue a claim of
violation of his speedy trial rights in the appellate courts of the state of Mississippi, should
he determine such is an arguable claim.2 As such, there are available state procedures in
which Lewis may assert his claim. Failure to exhaust available state court remedies clearly

2

Respondent notes that there is no right under Mississippi law to seek an interlocutory
appeal regarding speedy trial prior to a trial or plea, so any potential claim challenging the
violation of petitioner’s rights to a speedy trial would have to be pursued on appeal. See De La
Beckwith v. State, 615 So. 2d 1134 (Miss. 1992), reh’g denied, April 22, 1993.
7

warrants dismissal of the instant federal habeas corpus petition. See 28 U.S.C. §2254(b) and
(c), supra; Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509 (1982); Duckworth v. Serrano, 454 U.S. 1 (1981).
Furthermore, even assuming arguendo that this Court finds the speedy trial claim has
been properly exhausted, Lewis is not allowed to seek federal habeas relief based on his
speedy trial allegations of the instant petition absent “special circumstances.” See Dickerson,
816 F.2d at 227. The Fifth Circuit broached this “special circumstance” issue in Dickerson,
supra, and declined to accept the petitioner’s analysis that the Sixth Amendment right to a
speedy trial was a per se “special circumstance.” The Court reasoned that “to do so would
eliminate the careful distinction drawn by the court in Braden, supra, and reiterated in cases
like Brown and Atkins [v. People of State of Mich., 644 F.2d 543, 546-47 (6th Cir. 1981)]
between a defendant disrupting the orderly functioning of a state’s judicial processes as
opposed to enforcing his right to have the state bring him promptly to trial.” Id.
In the instant petition, Lewis does not specifically argue “special circumstances” to
warrant disruption of the state’s judicial process. In fact, as noted above, a portion of the
delay is due to Lewis - whether it was at his counsel’s request for plea negotiations or for the
defense’s request for a mental evaluation. Further, as previously discussed, Lewis specifically
waived his right to a speedy trial at various times and most recently from the time he
requested a mental evaluation until a ruling on his competency. Recent continuance orders
reflect that Lewis asserted that right in May 2017, and his case is currently set for trial in
September 2017. Therefore, Respondent respectfully submits that, to the extent that
8

petitioner seeks to raise a claim challenging the delay in trial, the instant petition should be
dismissed with prejudice for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted or,
alternatively dismissed without prejudice for failure to exhaust.
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, respondent respectfully moves this
Court to dismiss the instant petition with prejudice for failure to state a claim upon which
relief can be granted or, alternatively, without prejudice for failure to exhaust. Additionally,
Respondent moves this Court to dispense with the necessity of filing a brief in support of the
motion as the motion is self-explanatory.
