MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

I.

INTRODUCTION
Over 200 years ago, the framers of the U.S. Constitution recognized that written works

7

and other forms of artistic expression were deserving of legal protection. U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8.

8

These fundamental principles regarding protecting and fostering artistic creation did not

9

disappear simply because artistic works have transitioned from tangible to digital. Metro-

10

Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545 U.S. 913, 928-929 (2005) (citing the concern

11

that “digital distribution of copyrighted material threatens copyright holders as never before”).

12

The digital age, however, has allowed infringement to occur on a massive scale. Righthaven was

13

created precisely to stem this tide of unabashed copyright infringement on the Internet brought

14

about by the technological ease of copying. While various defendants and media sources,

15

whether mainstream or blogosphere posts, go to great lengths to portray Righthaven’s business

16

purpose in a negative light, there is nothing wrong with a party focused on protecting intellectual

17

property—except, of course, from the perspective of an infringer.

18

Righthaven earnestly desires to fully comply with decisional law so that it properly

19

obtains standing to seek redress for the unauthorized replication of copyrighted works to which it

20

has been assigned ownership. Righthaven is also cognizant of the fact that the issues presented

21

to this Court and that have been presented to other courts adjudicating Righthaven cases, involve

22

areas of the law that have yet to be fully developed. In this regard, while Righthaven

23

respectfully disagrees with the recent decision in Righthaven LLC v. Hoehn, 2011 WL 2441020,

24

at *6 (D. Nev. June 20, 2011)(“Hoehn”), the company expressly entered into a new contractual

25

agreement with Stephens Media LLC (“Stephens Media”) to address the concerns over certain

26

provisions contained in the May 9, 2011 Clarification and Amendment to Strategic Alliance

27

Agreement (the “Clarification”). (Mangano Decl. Ex. 1 at 1.) Righthaven’s efforts resulted in

28

the Amended and Restated Strategic Alliance Agreement (the “Restated Amendment”), which

2

Case 2:11-cv-00720-RCJ -GWF Document 13

Filed 07/19/11 Page 3 of 16

1

the company maintains resolves any doubt as to its ability to sue for infringement of assigned

2

copyrighted content.1
First, the Restated Amendment clearly and unequivocally grants Stephens Media a non-

3
4

exclusive license to exploit assigned copyrighted works. (Mangano Decl. Ex. 1 at 2.) The

5

Restated Amendment also eliminates Righthaven’s obligation to give Stephens Media 30 days

6

advance notice before being able to exploit a copyrighted work for any purpose other than in

7

connection with an infringement action, which was a concern expressed in the Hoehn decision.

8

(Id. at 3.) Moreover, the Restated Amendment replaces Stephens Media’s 14-day right to

9

repurchase a copyrighted work with the considerably more restrictive right to repurchase such

10

content for fair market value five years after assigning the work to Righthaven. (Id.) notice

11

before assigning a work to another party and removes Stephens Media’s 30-day right to

12

repurchase an assigned work. Likewise, these provisions were expressly revised to address the

13

concerns expressed in the Hoehn decision. In short, the Restated Amendment is a response to

14

the analysis provided in the Hoehn decision and, as such, it should be found to effectively confer

15

Righthaven standing to maintain its copyright infringement claims in this case.
To the extent the Court somehow refuses to consider the Restated Amendment,

16
17

Righthaven asks the Court to find that it as standing in view of the Clarification. (Gibson Decl.

18

Ex. 3; Hinueber Decl. Ex. 3.) The decision in Righthaven LLC v. Democratic Underground,

19

LLC, 2011 WL 2378186, at *6 (D. Nev. June 20, 2011) (“Democratic Underground”), which in

20

addition to Hoehn is relied upon extensively by Defendants, did not consider Righthaven’s

21

standing to sue under the clarified version of the SAA.2 Likewise, while the Hoehn decision

22

discussed the Clarification, it did not expressly conclude that it was part of the required standing

23

analysis. (Case No. 2:11-cv-00050-PMP-RJJ, Doc. # 28 at 10 “Even assuming that the May 9,

The Restated Amendment is the operative version of the Strategic Alliance Agreement (the
“SAA”) governing the contractual relationship between Righthaven and Stephens Media.
(Mangano Decl. Ex. 1). To the extent formal supplementation of the Complaint is deemed
necessary for the Court to perform its standing analysis in view of the Clarification and Restated
Amendment, Righthaven has concurrently filed the Motion to Amend with this response.
2
The Democratic Underground decision confined its standing analysis to facts existing at the
time the complaint was filed. (Case No. 2:10-cv-01356-RLH-GWF, Doc. # 116 at 7, 8 n.1.)

Filed 07/19/11 Page 4 of 16

1

2011 Clarification can change the jurisdictional analysis as they existed at the time of filing of

2

the suit . . . ”.) In sum, the Hoehn decision’s uncertainty as to the Clarification’s application

3

clearly calls in question whether standing in view of the Clarification would be considered upon

4

appeal to the Ninth Circuit. Thus, while Righthaven is certainly mindful of a natural inclination

5

to give deference to the Democratic Underground and Hoehn decisions, the company

6

respectfully asks this Court to independently examine the issue of standing under the

7

Clarification.3
Substantively Righthaven obtained all right, title and interest in the copyrighted work

8
9

before the Court (the “Work”), and has granted Stephens Media a non-exclusive license to

10

exploit the Work through the Clarification. (Gibson Decl. Ex. 3; Hinueber Decl. Ex. 3.) No

11

controlling authority compels a finding that this transactional structure insufficiently conveys

12

standing to pursue past—or future—claims of infringement simply because the assignee was

13

created to enforce the intellectual property rights it acquired. Indeed, if that were the law,

14

countless non-practicing entities would be deprived of standing to bring patent infringement

15

claims.
Contrary to the arguable advisory analysis contained in the Hoehn decision, the optional

16
17

recapture capabilities granted to Stephens Media under the Clarification should not impact

18

Righthaven’s ability to maintain this action. It is well established that limitations or restrictions

19

do not invalidate an otherwise valid assignment. Indeed, Courts of Appeals throughout the

20

country have rejected the argument that such limitations suggest a sham.
Finally, Righthaven maintains that it has, at a minimum, standing to sue for accrued

21
22

copyright infringement claims based on the plain language of the executed assignment for the

23

Work in this case (the “Assignment”) despite the license-back to Stephens Media of certain

24

rights under the SAA. (Gibson Decl. Ex. 2; Hinueber Decl. Ex. 2.) It is black letter law that at

25

the moment such an assignment occurs, Righthaven, as the current copyright owner, has standing

26

3

27
28

It should be noted that Defendants should be precluded from barring Righthaven’s reliance on
the Clarification as over half of their Motion argues the absence of standing despite the
Clarification’s language. (Doc. # 6 at 6-14.) In doing so, Defendants have placed the
Clarification at issue and they should be deemed to have waived any argument based on the fact
that it was not in existence as of the filing of the Complaint.
4

Case 2:11-cv-00720-RCJ -GWF Document 13

Filed 07/19/11 Page 5 of 16

1

to pursue an accrued claim for infringement. This is a much different situation than in Silvers v.

2

Sony Pictures Entm’t Inc., 402 F.3d 881, 884 (9th Cir. 2005)(“Silvers”), where the plaintiff,

3

assigned only a bare right to sue for past copyright infringement, lacked standing. To the extent

4

contrary findings were made in Democratic Underground and in Hoehn, Righthaven respectfully

5

disagrees with these conclusions.

6

In short, Righthaven has standing to maintain this case given the content of the Restated

7

Amendment, which was expressly prepared in response to the concerns expressed in the Hoehn

8

decision. (Mangano Decl. Ex. 1 at 1.) The Democratic Underground and Hoehn decisions do

9

not alter Righthaven’s unequivocal standing to sue for infringement under the terms of the

10

Restated Amendment. Should the Court somehow refuse to consider the Restated Amendment,

11

Righthaven maintains that despite the decisions reached in Democratic Underground and Hoehn

12

cases, it has standing to maintain this case in view of the Clarification and, even more

13

fundamentally, under the Assignment. Accordingly, Righthaven respectfully asks the Court to

14

deny Defendants’ Motion and find it has standing to bring this action.

15

II.

16

ARGUMENT
A.

17
18

Righthaven Unquestionably Has Standing to Sue Under the Restated
Amendment.

There can be no doubt that Righthaven has standing to maintain this case under the

19

Restated Amendment. In fact, the Restated Amendment was expressly designed to address the

20

concerns set forth in the Hoehn decision, which sets forth the most comprehensive and

21

instructive discussion to date concerning the alleged contractual provisions that divest the

22

company of standing to sue over content assigned to it by Stephens Media. (Mangano Decl. Ex.

23

1 at 1.) The Restated Amendment further renders Defendants’ extensive reliance on the Hoehn

24

decision moot.

25

First, the Restated Amendment fully clarifies that Stephens Media holds a non-exclusive

26

license to exploit the works assigned to Righthaven. (Id.) As a non-exclusive licensee, Stephens

27

Media cannot sue for infringement of the Work. See Davis v. Blige, 505 F.3d 90, 101 (2d Cir.

28

2007)(“[T]he holder of a nonexclusive license may not sue others for infringement.”); I.A.E., Inc.

5

Case 2:11-cv-00720-RCJ -GWF Document 13

Filed 07/19/11 Page 6 of 16

1

v. Shaver, 74 F.3d 768, 775 (7th Cir. 1996)(“[A] person holding a nonexclusive license has no

2

standing to sue for copyright infringement.”); Eden Toys, Inc. v. Florelee Undergarment Co.,

3

697 F.2d 27, 32 (2d Cir. 1982)(“The Copyright Act authorizes only to types of claimants to sue

4

for copyright infringement: (1) owners of copyrights, and (2) persons who have been granted

5

exclusive licenses by owners of copyrights.”). Rather, the right to sue for infringement of the

6

work is held by Righthaven, which acquired ownership of the Work based on the Assignment

7

from Stephens Media. See 17 U.S.C. § 101; 17 U.S.C. § 501(b).

8
9

Second, the Restated Amendment eliminates two provisions that were concerns in the
Hoehn decision: (1) a provision giving Stephens Media 30 days written notice prior to exploiting

10

an infringed work; and (2) a separate provision giving Stephens Media the option to repurchase

11

the copyright. (Doc. # 28 at 10.) The 30-day notice provision has been completely eliminated

12

from the Restated Amendment. (Mangano Decl. Ex. 1.) Likewise, Stephens Media’s option to

13

repurchase and assigned work may only be exercised five years after the date of assignment and

14

fair market value must be paid to require a work. (Id.) Thus, Righthaven owns the works for at

15

least a five-year term without the possibility of Stephens Media exercising its option to

16

repurchase shortly after assignment under a potential scenario recognized in the Hoehn decision

17

given the terms of the Clarification.

18

Finally, the Restated Amendment does not restrict Righthaven’s ability to exploit

19

assigned works in any manner. Under the Clarification, the Hoehn decision expressed concern

20

over the requirement that Righthaven notify Stephens Media of its intent to exploit any work

21

outside of copyright infringement litigation. This notice requirement does not exist under the

22

Restated Amendment. (Mangano Decl. Ex. 1.) Moreover, there is no restriction imposed on

23

Righthaven’s ability to exploit works or to license works to other parties. (Id.)

24

Quite frankly, Righthaven has sought to fully address all of the concerns expressed in the

25

Hoehn decision. In doing so, this Court is presented with record that is unlike those at issue in

26

either the Democratic Underground or the Hoehn decisions. Most importantly, however,

27

Righthaven has protectively addressed the concerns expressed as an impediment to it having

28

6

Case 2:11-cv-00720-RCJ -GWF Document 13

Filed 07/19/11 Page 7 of 16

1

standing. Accordingly, the Court should find Righthaven has standing to maintain this action

2

under the Restated Amendment.

3
4
5

B.

Righthaven Has Standing to Sue for Infringements Under the Clarification.

It is black-letter law that a copyright owner has standing to bring a claim for

6

infringement. 17 U.S.C. § 501(b) (“The legal or beneficial owner of an exclusive right under a

7

copyright is entitled … to institute an action for any infringement of that particular right ….”). A

8

copyright owner need not have been the author or original owner; indeed, copyright law

9

recognizes the transferability of the rights protected by copyright. 17 U.S.C. § 101 (“A ‘transfer

10

of copyright ownership’ is an assignment, mortgage, exclusive license, or any other conveyance,

11

alienation, or hypothecation of a copyright or of any of the exclusive rights comprised in a

12

copyright, whether or not it is limited in time or place of effect, but not including a nonexclusive

13

license.”) It is also black-letter law that a non-exclusive licensee lacks standing to sue for

14

infringement. See id.; Silvers, 402 F.3d at 898 n. 7.

15

Pursuant to the Clarification, Righthaven obtained “all right, title and interest to said

16

Work such that Righthaven shall be recognized as the copyright owner of the Work, shall have

17

the right to register said Work with the United States Copyright Office, and shall have the right

18

to pursue past, present and future infringements of the copyright in and to the Work.” (Gibson

19

Decl. Ex. 3; Hinueber Decl. Ex. 3.) As the owner of the copyright, Righthaven has the ability to

20

exploit its exclusive rights as it sees fit. Righthaven may reproduce the copyrighted work, create

21

derivative works, assign the copyright, grant licenses, receive royalty payments and sue for

22

copyright infringement. In short, Righthaven may utilize the entire bundle of exclusive rights

23

that accompany copyright ownership. Nothing in the Assignment or Clarification prevents

24

Righthaven from doing so. Righthaven granted a non-exclusive license back to Stephens Media

25

to use the copyrighted work (Id. Ex. 3 at § 7.2; Hinueber Decl. Ex. 3 at § 7.2), but that license

26

does not divest Righthaven of its rights. See Silvers, 402 F.3d at 898 n. 7.

27
28

Righthaven acknowledges the Hoehn decision did find, although potentially advisory in
nature, that it lacked standing failed to bring suit for past infringement after considering the SAA

7

Case 2:11-cv-00720-RCJ -GWF Document 13

Filed 07/19/11 Page 8 of 16

1

and the Clarification. Righthaven respectfully maintains the court erred in reaching this

2

conclusion. First, the Silvers decision did not involve a substantive evaluation of underlying

3

contractual rights and responsibilities. Rather, in Silvers, the copyright owner executed an

4

“Assignment of Claims and Causes of Action” in favor of the plaintiff, and retained ownership of

5

the underlying copyright. Silvers, 402 F.3d at 883. The copyright owner in Silvers never

6

purported to assign the underlying work itself, or any rights protected by copyright. Thus in

7

Silvers, the only right, title and interest assigned was the right, title and interest in litigation.

8

That is not the case before this Court.

9

Another case also relied on in the Hoehn decision, Nafal v. Carter, 540 F. Supp. 2d 1128

10

(C.D. Cal. 2007), is similarly inapposite. As a preliminary matter, Nafal was decided under the

11

more narrow 1909 Copyright Act (id. at 1138), which, in contrast to the 1976 Copyright Act, did

12

not allow the bundle of rights protected by copyright to be separable. Silvers, 402 F.3d 881 at

13

896. Moreover, the plaintiff in Nafal never alleged that he owned the copyright at issue. Instead

14

he was assigned a purported one-half interest to an exclusive licensee’s rights but lacked any

15

ability to exercise any rights under the copyright. 540 F. Supp. 2d at 1143. Additionally the

16

plaintiff in Nafal was not a party to the original exclusive license agreement with the copyright

17

owner (id. at 1141) and was also not t a co-exclusive licensee because he lacked any of the rights

18

held by the other co-licensee (id. at 1142). Here, by contrast, the original copyright owner,

19

Stephens Media, assigned the entirety of the Work to Righthaven, and Righthaven granted back

20

to Stephens Media only the right to exploit the copyright on a non-exclusive basis under the

21

Clarification. (Mangano Decl. Exs. 2; Gibson Decl. Ex. 3; Hinueber Decl. Ex. 3.) Under these

22

circumstances, the only party to the transaction with any exclusive rights and the only party with

23

standing to sue for copyright infringement is Righthaven.

24
25

C.

Neither the Purpose of the Transaction nor Stephens Media’s Retention of
Certain Rights Under the Clarification Invalidates the Assignment.

26

The Hoehn decision called into question the existence of two provisions in the

27

Clarification: a provision giving Stephens Media 30 days written notice prior to exploiting an

28

infringed work and a separate provision giving Stephens Media the option to re-purchase the

8

Case 2:11-cv-00720-RCJ -GWF Document 13

Filed 07/19/11 Page 9 of 16

1

copyright. Any concerns over the effect of these provisions have been fully addressed in the

2

Restated Amendment. (Mangano Decl. Ex. 1.) To the extent the Court somehow declines to

3

consider the Restated Amendment, Righthaven respectfully asserts that the Clarification’s

4

provisions do not invalidate the rights assigned by Stephens Media, which includes the right to

5

sue for, at least, acts of past infringement.

6

Parties routinely enter into complex agreements transferring intellectual property rights.

7

It is well established that these transfers are not invalid simply because the original owner retains

8

some rights. See, e.g., Vittoria N. Am., L.L.C. v. Euro-Asia Imports Inc., 278 F.3d 1076,

9

1082 (10th Cir. 2001) (holding that a “thirty-day reassignment clause does not establish that [the

10

trademark assignment] is a sham”) (citing Premier Dental Prods. Co. v. Darby Dental Supply

11

Co., 794 F.2d 850, 855-56 (3d Cir. 1986) (“[L]imitations in an otherwise valid assignment do not

12

invalidate it”)); Int’l Armament Corp. v. Matra Manurhin Int’l., Inc., 630 F. Supp. 741,

13

746 (E.D. Va. 1986) (“Plaintiff’s ownership of the marks is subject to conditions on its license

14

agreement with Carl Walther, which make that distributorship revocable by Walther for violation

15

of ‘essential’ clauses. Such limitations on an assignment do not invalidate or make it a sham,

16

however.”)

17

Moreover, the Ninth Circuit, more than 40 years ago, rejected the argument that an

18

assignment made solely to facilitate a lawsuit is somehow improper. In Rawlings v. Nat’l

19

Molasses Co., 394 F.2d 645, 648 (9th Cir. 1968), the Ninth Circuit held:

20
21
22
23

Defendants make the further point that the arrangement between plaintiff and
[assignor] was accomplished for the sole purpose of permitting plaintiff to bring
this action without joining [assignor] as a party plaintiff or defendant. We assume
that to be true. Defendants urge that the transaction was a sham. The documents
were in fact executed and nothing in the record indicates that as between
[assignor] and plaintiff they are either void or voidable. If not, then the purpose
underlying their execution is of no concern to the defendants.

24

Thus, the Ninth Circuit long ago rejected the argument that the purpose behind a business

25

transaction or a business itself has any bearing on the issue of standing.

26

Finally, as the Ninth Circuit held in Silvers, courts “should interpret the Copyright Act

27

consistently with the requirement of the Patent Act” because of the fundamental similarity

28

between the two types of intellectual property rights. 402 F.3d at 888; see also Davis, 505 F.3d
9

Case 2:11-cv-00720-RCJ -GWF Document 13

Filed 07/19/11 Page 10 of 16

1

at 104 (“Although patent and copyright law function somewhat differently, courts considering

2

one have historically looked to the other for guidance where precedent is lacking . . . . Licenses

3

in patent and copyright function similarly . . . .”).

4

Courts in numerous patent cases have rejected the argument that an otherwise valid

5

transfer of intellectual property rights made to confer standing is somehow defective, or a sham,

6

because the motivating business purpose is litigation. For example, in a highly analogous case in

7

the patent context, the Federal Circuit held that patent assignments made for the sole purpose of

8

bringing suit are nonetheless valid. SGS-Thomson Microelectronics, Inc. v. Int’l Rectifier Corp.,

9

1994 WL 374529 (Fed. Cir. Jul. 14, 1994). There, the defendant urged the court to ignore the

10

patent assignment between related corporate entities because, like here, the agreement was

11

entered for the purpose of conferring standing to sue for infringement. The defendant also

12

argued “sham” because the assignment required the plaintiff to assign the patents back at the

13

conclusion of the litigation, a much greater restriction than that present in this case. Id. at *6.

14

The court rejected defendant’s arguments, ruling that “[t]his court and other courts have held that

15

an assignment that explicitly provides for possible transfer back to the assignor is nevertheless

16

effective to give the assignee standing.” Id. The court further held that:

17
18
19
20

the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the ground that the
assignments of the … patents were shams because the sole purpose of the
assignment was to facilitate litigation. In so ruling, the trial court ignored the
express language in the assignments and in effect created a new requirement, not
found in any case law, that a patent assignment must have an “independent
business purpose.”

21

Id. Thus, in the very context that Silvers advises courts to consider, the Federal Circuit

22

explicitly ruled that the motive or purpose of an assignment is irrelevant to the assignee’s

23

standing to enforce the exclusive rights conferred and that the assignor’s ability to re-acquire its

24

rights does not deprive the assignee of its right to bring suit. Id. at *6-7.

25

In yet another case decided by the Federal Circuit, the court held that a grant of patent

26

rights was sufficient to confer standing notwithstanding the fact that the grantor retained several

27

rights relating to the patent. See Vaupel Textilmaschinen KG v. Meccanica Euro Italia S.P.A.,

28

944 F.2d 870 (Fed. Cir. 1991). In Vaupel, the grantor retained “1) a veto right on sublicensing

10

Case 2:11-cv-00720-RCJ -GWF Document 13

Filed 07/19/11 Page 11 of 16

1

by Vaupel; 2) the right to obtain patents on the invention in other countries; 3) a reversionary

2

right to the patent in the event of bankruptcy or termination of production by Vaupel; and 4) a

3

right to receive infringement damages.” Id. at 875. Despite the grantor’s retention of these

4

rights, the court held that “none of these reserved rights was so substantial as to reduce the

5

transfer to a mere license or indicate an intent not to transfer all substantial rights.” Id. Here, as

6

in Vaupel, the rights retained by Stephens Media do not negate the exclusive rights conferred to

7

Righthaven; thus, Righthaven is the owner of the copyright and has standing to sue for

8

infringement.

9

D.

At a Minimum, Righthaven Has Standing to Sue for Past Infringements
Under the Assignments.

10
11

Binding precedent establishes that the Assignment from Stephens Media to Righthaven

12

confers standing to bring suit for the accrued copyright infringement claims at issue in this case

13

to Righthaven.

14

In Silvers, the Ninth Circuit held that an assignor can transfer the ownership interest in an

15

accrued past infringement, but the assignee has standing to sue only if the interest in the past

16

infringement is expressly included in the assignment and the assignee is also granted ownership

17

of an exclusive right in the copyrighted work. Id. at 889-90. In so holding, the panel in Silvers

18

aligned Ninth Circuit law with that of the Second Circuit as set forth in ABKCO Music, Inc. v.

19

Harrisongs Music, Ltd., 944 F.2d 971, 980 (2d Cir. 1991), which recognized the right to sue for

20

past infringement when both the copyright and the accrued claims were purchased. Silvers, 402

21

F.3d at 889.

22

Multiple courts in this district have previously found the plain language of the identical

23

copyright assignments conferred standing upon Righthaven to sue for past infringement under

24

the Silvers requirements:

(See also Gibson Decl. ¶¶ 9-10.)4 Most recently, Judge Navarro declined to dismiss
Righthaven’s complaint for want of standing in the Virginia Citizens case despite her knowledge
of the Democratic Underground and Hoehn decisions. (Doc. # 26 at 11-14.) Rather, Judge
Navarro astutely noted that any substantive analysis of the assignment’s validity should be
decided through a motion for summary judgment after the parties had conducted discovery.
(Id. at 13:10-13, emphasis added.)
As with the assignments in the above cases, the Assignment at issue here transferred all

10
11

Filed 07/19/11 Page 12 of 16

exclusive ownership rights in and to the works to Righthaven, and expressly included all accrued
causes of action for copyright infringement:
Assignor hereby transfers, vests and assigns [the Work]…to
Righthaven…all copyrights requisite to have Righthaven recognized as the
copyright owner of the Work for purposes of Righthaven being able to
claim ownership as well as the right to seek redress for past, present and
future infringements of the copyright in and to the Work.

17

(Gibson Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. 1; Hinueber Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. 1; Mangano Decl. Exs. 2, emphasis

added.) At the moment of the Assignments, Righthaven became the owner of the Work

19

with all rights of ownership, including the right to register the Work, license the Work

20

and to, at a minimum, seek redress for accrued infringement claims. In other words, the

The Democratic Underground decision mischaracterized Righthaven’s reliance on these
decisions as being “[a]t best . . . disingenuous.” (Doc. # 116 at 10:16-17.) Righthaven
respectfully maintains that its reliance on these cases, both here and in the Democratic
Underground case, are not and were not disingenuously asserted in any way. To clarify any
misunderstanding this Court may construe from the harsh language contained in the Democratic
Underground decision, Righthaven cites these prior decisions in support of its proposition that
courts from this judicial district have found that the plain language of the assignments at issue
complied with the requirements of the Silvers decision. Consistent with these prior decisions, the
Democratic Underground decision did not conclude the plain language of the assignment at issue
violated the requirements of the Silvers decision. (See Doc. # 116 at 6-11.) Rather, the
Democratic Underground decision found that the assignment in view of the original SAA terms
failed to comply with the Silvers decision. (Id. at 6.)

12

Case 2:11-cv-00720-RCJ -GWF Document 13

1

Assignment conferred upon Righthaven the exclusive rights required under the Copyright

2

Act to at least bring suit for any infringement that occurred prior to Stephens Media’s

3

assignment to Righthaven. As parties frequently do, Righthaven licensed back to

4

Stephens Media the right to exploit the works.

5

While parties in numerous other actions have alleged that this transactional structure

6

constitutes a “sham” or meaningless assignment, adopting these allegations by a finding that

7

Righthaven lacks standing to maintain this action for past infringement would eviscerate

8

countless complex commercial and intellectual property transactions. “Principles of contract law

9

are generally applicable in the construction of copyright assignments, licenses and other transfers

10

of rights.” Key Maps, Inc. v. Pruitt, 470 F. Supp. 33, 38 (S.D. Tex. 1978). An assignment

11

transfers all rights, title and interest in and to the assigned property. See id.; see also Pressley’s

12

Estate v. Russen, 513 F. Supp. 1339, 1350 (D. N. J. 1981) (“An assignment passes legal and

13

equitable title to the property . . . .”). Axiomatically, when the totality of rights are assigned by

14

one party to another, and the party receiving said assignment then conveys a license of some

15

interest to the same party or to another party, complete title to ownership vests in the assignee

16

prior to being divested through licensure.

17

The assignment and license-back transactional structure described in the SAA does not

18

eliminate Righthaven’s ability to bring suit for past infringements, which is precisely what is at

19

issue in this case. As the Ninth Circuit held in Silvers, the right to sue for past infringement

20

requires only an assignment of an ownership interest along with the expressed right to sue for an

21

accrued claim for infringement. Silvers, 402 F.3d at 889-90. Copyright ownership was

22

transferred to Righthaven by the Assignment along with at least a perfected right to sue for past

23

infringements. Neither the Democratic Underground nor the Hoehn decision addressed the

24

temporal transfer of ownership and the right to sue for past infringements through Stephens

25

Media’s assignments to Righthaven. Rather, these decisions coupled the assignments with the

26

SAA’s terms to find the transaction structure failed to meet the requirements of Silvers.

27

Righthaven respectfully disagrees with this conclusion.

28

13

1

While Righthaven promises under the SAA to license back to Stephens Media the right to

2

exploit the acquired works, there can be no license until after the assignment of ownership rights

3

and the right to sue for past infringements is conveyed. This structure clearly conveys ownership

4

and the right to sue for accrued infringement claims as is required to establish standing to sue for

5

an accrued infringement claim under Silvers. Finding otherwise requires the transfer of

6

ownership through the Assignments along with the right to sue for, at least, past copyright

7

infringements to be completely disregarded because of the post-assignment rights licensed back

8

to Stephens Media.

E.

10

Defendants’ Claim That Righthaven Has Willfully Deceived The Court is
Wholly Without Merit.

11

In a transparent attempt to benefit from the groundswell of Internet-based conspiracy

12

theories and baseless attacks against the propriety of its alleged business model, along with the

13

inflammatory statements contained in the Democratic Underground decision5, Defendants

14

alternatively request dismissal of Righthaven’s Complaint because it has willfully deceived the

15

Court. (Doc. # 6 at 14-16.) As the above arguments clearly establish, Righthaven has standing

16

to maintain this action for past infringement of the Work under the Restated Amendment, the

17

Clarification or, at a minimum, the Assignment. (Mangano Decl. Ex. 1; Gibson Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. 1;

18

Hinueber Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. 1.)
Given the above-cited authority and the submitted supporting materials, Defendants

19
20

cannot establish facts sufficient to justify dismissal of Righthaven’s Complaint on the ground

21

that it willfully deceived this Court by filing this action. In short, the record before the Court

22

demonstrates Righthaven’s entitlement to maintain this action. Accordingly, Defendants’

23

The Democratic Underground decision stands alone in its glaring contempt for Righthaven’s
business model and its attempt to acquire ownership rights necessary to vest it with standing.
Subsequent decisions from this District have either declined to find that Righthaven lacks
standing given the procedural posture of the action and the nature of the claimed deficiency
(Virginia Citizens, Doc. # 26 at 11-14) or have determined Righthaven lacks standing under the
SAA without consideration of the assignment’s language or the contents of the Clarification
(Righthaven LLC v. Mostofi, Case No. 2:10-cv-01066-KJD-GWF, Doc. # 34 at 4-8). In these
decisions, and even in the Hoehn decision, the courts were far more even-handed in their
analysis than that contained in the Democratic Underground decision.
