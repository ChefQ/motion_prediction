DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS
FOR LACK OF SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION
Defendants NewsBlaze LLC, and Alan Gray (collectively, “NewsBlaze,” or the
“Defendants”), by and through their counsel, move to dismiss Plaintiff Righthaven, LLC’s
(hereinafter “Righthaven[’s],” or the “Plaintiff[’s]”) Complaint (Doc. # 1) filed on May 5, 2011
for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and
Local Rule 7.2.
I. Introduction
Plaintiff filed this lawsuit against the Defendants on May 5, 2011, which NewsBlaze now
responds to with this Motion to Dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Pursuant to this
Court’s April 14, 2011 Order in Righthaven LLC v. Democratic Underground LLC, Case No.
2:10-cv-01356, Doc. # 93 (D. Nev. Apr. 14, 2011), evidence regarding Righthaven’s relationship

public.

Memorandum Addressing Recently Produced Evidence Relating to Pending Motions in the

4

Democratic Underground case was made available on the Public Access to Court Electronic

5

Records (“PACER”) system, as well as this court’s CM/ECF system. Case No. 2:10-cv-01356

6

Doc. # 79 (D. Nev. Mar. 9, 2011). A true and correct copy of Exhibit A to Doc. # 79 in

7

Democratic Underground is attached to this Motion as Exhibit A.

On April 15, 2011, an unredacted version of the Defendants’ Supplemental

8

This document clearly reveals that Righthaven lacked the rights to bring this suit, and

9

thus this court lacks jurisdiction over this matter. Nevertheless, on May 9, 2011, Righthaven

10

executed a “Clarification” (hereinafter, the “‘Clarification’”) of the Agreement between

11

Righthaven and Stephens Media LLC (hereinafter, “Stephens Media”). This execued document

12

was filed with the court in numerous cases, including Righthaven LLC v. Hoehn, 2:11-cv-00050

13

(Doc. # 24 Exh. 3) (D. Nev. May 9, 2011); a true and correct copy of this “Clarification” is

14

attached to this Motion as Exhibit B. This “Clarification” supposedly rectifies the defects in

15

Righthaven’s Agreement, which governs the terms on which Stephens Media assigns its

16

copyrights to Righthaven. The “Clarification”, however, does no such thing, and serves only as

17

a cynical attempt to obfuscate the unlawful nature of Righthaven’s enterprise: The

18

“Clarification,” along with the Agreement, is a mere acquisition of the right to sue for copyright

19

infringement without the true transfer of any other rights under Title 17. Just days ago, this

20

District found that Righthaven lacked standing and therefore subject matter jurisdiction to bring

21

a nearly identical case, Righthaven LLC v. Democratic Underground LLC, Case No. 2:10-cv-

22

01356 (Doc. # 116) (D. Nev. June 14, 2011).

23

Under Rule 12(b)(1), subject matter jurisdiction is an essential element to every lawsuit,

24

and must be present for any court to hear a dispute. In this case, Righthaven does not have

25

sufficient rights in the work putatively assigned to it by Stephens Media to bring – or maintain –

II. Legal Standards

2

Subject matter jurisdiction is an essential element to every lawsuit and must be

3

demonstrated “at the successive stages of the litigation.” Chapman v. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.), Inc.,

4

631 F.3d 939, 954 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561

5

(1992)). The existence of subject matter jurisdiction is an ongoing inquiry that a court must

6

conduct sua sponte in order to continue the case. Chapman, 631 F.3d at 954; Bernhardt v.

7

County of Los Angeles, 279 F.3d 862, 868 (9th Cir. 2002). Where subject matter jurisdiction is

8

absent, a court has no discretion and must dismiss the case. Chapman, 631 F.3d at 954.

9

A central component to subject matter jurisdiction is the question of standing, which

10

requires that the party experience actual or imminent harm. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (citing

11

Whitmore v. Ark., 495 U.S. 149, 155 (1990)). A party’s standing to bring a case is not subject to

12

waiver, and can be used to dismiss the instant action at any time. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3); U.S. v.

13

Hays, 515 U.S. 737, 742 (1995); Chapman, 631 F.3d at 954.

14

III. Argument

15

A.

Righthaven Has No Standing to Bring This Case.
1. Righthaven’s Agreement Does Not Confer Sufficient Copyright Rights for

16

Righthaven to Bring this Lawsuit.

17
18

Righthaven is neither the owner nor exclusive holder of any rights in the copyrighted

19

work underlying this lawsuit. Copyright assignments occurring under Righthaven’s Agreement

20

with Stephens Media have been analyzed by this District, and found to transfer nothing more

21

than a bare right to sue – which is impermissible under the Copyright Act – and thus precluded

22

Righthaven from being recognized as the Copyright owner. Democratic Underground, Case No.

23

2:10-cv-01356 (Doc. # 116 at 6:3-7:13.) As such, Righthaven has suffered no injury or other

24

cognizable harm required for it to have standing under Lujan. Id. at 11:3-13. Absent this very

25

basic requirement of standing, there is no subject matter jurisdiction in this case, and it must be

dismissed.
For a plaintiff to sue for copyright infringement, it must have an exclusive right in a
copyright. Silvers v. Sony Pictures Entm’t, Inc., 402 F.3d 881, 885 (9th Cir. 2005); see

Case 2:11-cv-00720-RCJ -GWF Document 6

Filed 06/16/11 Page 4 of 17

1

Sybersound Records v. UAV Corp., 517 F.3d 1137, 1144 (holding that only owners and

2

“exclusive licensees” may enforce a copyright or license). Without such exclusivity, a plaintiff

3

has no standing to enforce a copyright. Sybersound, 517 F.3d at 1144. As status as a copyright

4

owner or exclusive licensee is prerequisite for enforcing such a right, a plaintiff with neither

5

lacks standing to pursue an infringement claim on that copyright, as it cannot experience the

6

injury requisite for Article III standing under Whitmore and Lujan.

7

Righthaven lacks sufficient rights under Silvers and Sybersound to bring this lawsuit.

8

The Strategic Alliance Agreement (hereinafter, the “Agreement”) between Stephens Media and

9

Righthaven found in Exhibit A obviates the need to examine the copyright assignment for the

10

work at issue in this case.1 Indeed, the Agreement makes it abundantly clear that Righthaven

11

actually has no rights in the copyrights it claims.

12

Agreement, Exhibit A, provides as follows:

13

Most importantly, Section 7.2 of the

Despite any such Copyright Assignment, Stephens Media shall retain (and is
hereby granted by Righthaven) an exclusive license to Exploit the Stephens
Media Assigned Copyrights for any lawful purpose whatsoever and Righthaven
shall have no right or license to Exploit or participate in the receipt of
royalties from the Exploitation of the Stephens Media Assigned Copyrights
other than the right to proceeds in association with a Recovery. To the extent
that Righthaven's maintenance of rights to pursue infringers of the Stephens
Media Assigned Copyrights in any manner would be deemed to diminish
Stephens Media's right to Exploit the Stephens Media Assigned Copyrights,
Righthaven hereby grants an exclusive license to Stephens Media to the greatest
extent permitted by law so that Stephens Media shall have unfettered and
exclusive ability to Exploit the Stephens Media Assigned Copyrights. Righthaven
shall have no Obligation to protect or enforce any Work of Stephens Media that is
not Stephens Media Assigned Copyrights.

Judge Hunt ordered this document to be made public in Righthaven LLC v. Democratic Underground LLC, Case
2:10-cv-1356 Order, Doc. # 93 (D. Nev., Apr. 14, 2011). His rationale included the fact that the contents of this
document would have an impact on all Righthaven cases. “As I have read these and other motions in this case, and
considered the multitude of cases filed by Righthaven, on the claimed basis that Righthaven owns the copyrights to
certain Stephens Media copy, it appears to the Court that there is certainly an interest and even a right in all the other
defendants sued by [Righthaven] to have access to this material.” Id. at 4.

works at issue in its lawsuits, it does not provide any transfer any of the rights in 17 U.S.C. § 106

2

that must be transferred to make a valid copyright assignment or license, and thus grant the

3

assignee the right to sue. See Silvers, 402 F.3d at 885; Democratic Underground, Case No. 2:10-

4

cv-01356 (Doc. # 116 at 6:3-17). The “assignment” is a transparent sham that is designed to

5

make Righthaven appear to be a copyright assignee for the purposes of filing suit, meanwhile the

6

actual rights at issue are governed by this Agreement, which renders the assignment

7

meaningless. (Exh. A.) The Agreement even specifically precludes Righthaven from the most

8

basic of assignee rights and prohibits Righthaven from “Exploit[ing]” (Exh. A at Schedule 1) the

9

copyrighted works through distribution, publication or licensing. In the end, Stephens Media is

10

the only party to the Agreement with any exclusive rights in the copyrighted content.

11

But that is not the full extent of the sham and the fraud that has been perpetrated upon

12

this court hundreds of times – as a right of reversion is also included in the Agreement. As seen

13

in Section 8 of the Agreement, Exhibit A:

14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24

Stephens Media shall have the right at any time to terminate, in good faith, any
Copyright Assignment (the "Assignment Termination") and enjoy a right of
complete reversion to the ownership of any copyright that is the subject of a
Copyright Assignment; provided, however, that if Righthaven shall have
commenced an action to prosecute an infringer of the Stephens Media Assigned
Copyrights, Stephens Media shall be exclusively responsible for effecting
termination of such action including, without limitation, all Losses associated
with any dismissal with prejudice.
In addition to Stephens Media having the exclusive license to use the copyrights for everything
but Righthaven’s lawsuits, it also retains the ability to reclaim those rights at any time.
Righthaven does not even acquire the exclusive right to sue, as the full text of Section 8, found in
Exhibit A, specifically contemplates Stephens Media litigating the infringement of the copyrights
it assigns to Righthaven.

25

This is not a true copyright ownership that Righthaven has acquired, nor is it even an

26

exclusive license – it is simply an attempt to illegally assign a copyright claim. And it is exactly

27

that narrow, exploitative interest that the Ninth Circuit held flew in the face of the Copyright Act,

2. Righthaven’s “Clarification” Also Fails to Give Righthaven Standing.

5

Righthaven attempted to salvage its beleaguered Agreement by executing the

6

”Clarification,” which memorialized the parties’ intent in creating the initial Agreement. (Exh.

7

B.)

8

Righthaven’s naked use of its acquired copyrights as the basis of lawsuits – and only as the basis

9

of lawsuits – even clearer.

Contrary to Righthaven’s hopes, though, this “Clarification” served only to make

10

The “Clarification” does not retroactively remedy Righthaven’s lack of standing. While

11

a subsequently executed agreement provides clarification regarding the parties’ intent to cure

12

standing defects in copyright cases, it does not retroactively confer standing that previously did

13

not exist. See Billy-Bob Teeth, Inc. v. Novelty, Inc., 329 F.3d 586, 591 (7th Cir. 2003); Imperial

14

Residential Design, Inc. v. Palms Dev. Group, Inc., 70 F.3d 96, 99 (11th Cir. 1995); Arthur

15

Rutenberg Homes, Inc. v. Drew Homes, Inc., 29 F.3d 1529, 1532 (11th Cir. 1994); Infodek, Inc.

16

v. Meredith-Webb Printing Co., Inc., 830 F. Supp. 614, 620 (N.D. Ga. 1993). This District has

17

rejected Righthaven’s reliance on these cases; Righthaven is not able to create facts that would

18

potentially confer standing once the case has been filed. “‘The existence of federal jurisdiction

19

ordinarily depends on the facts as they exist when the complaint is filed.’” Lujan, 504 U.S. at

20

571 n.4 (1992) (quoting Newman-Green, Inc. v. Alfonzo-Larrain, 490 U.S. 826, 830 (1989))

21

(emphasis in Lujan); Democratic Underground, Case No. 2:10-cv-01356 (Doc. # 116 at 7:20-

22

22).

23

The “Clarification” is not relevant or binding on this case.

Righthaven filed its

24

Complaint against the Defendants (Doc. # 1) on May 5, 2011, and purported to obtain the

25

copyrights underlying this lawsuit from Stephens Media, prior to its May 9, 2011 execution of

the “Clarification.” Thus, the “Clarification” cannot be used to rescue Righthaven’s failed claim
of standing, or to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the court. Democratic Underground, Case
No. 2:10-cv-01356 (Doc. # 116 at 7:15-9:24). Nevertheless, the “Clarification” is analyzed to

demonstrate that, even if deemed effective by the Court, it undermines Righthaven’s standing to

2

bring suit under the copyrights “obtained” from Stephens Media.

3

i. The “Clarification” Denies Righthaven of Substantially All Ability to

4

Use Its Assigned Copyrighted for Anything – Except Lawsuits.

5

Despite the May 9, 2011 “Clarification,” Righthaven’s Agreement with Stephens Media

6

provides it with nothing more than the bare right to sue.

An important component of

7

Righthaven’s “Clarification” is the revision of Agreement § 7.2 (Exh. A § 7.2) to no longer give

8

Stephens Media an exclusive license to Exploit (defined in id. at Schedule 1) the copyrighted

9

works for “any lawful purpose” (id. § 7.2). In its place, as the putative owner of the copyright,

10

Righthaven has granted Stephens Media a non-exclusive license to Exploit the copyrighted work

11

“to the greatest extent permitted by law” on condition that 1) Stephens Media pay Righthaven

12

$1.00 per year for this right, and 2) that Righthaven give Stephens Media 30 days notice if it

13

decides to Exploit the copyrighted work or receive any royalties from the copyright’s use other

14

than in connection with lawsuits, with failure to do so constituting a material breach of the

15

Agreement. (Exh. B § 1.)

16

This aspect of the “Clarification” is problematic for numerous reasons.

First,

17

Righthaven’s non-exclusive license to Stephens Media contains no definitions as to duration,

18

geography or media covered, but haphazardly lets Stephens Media use the copyright assigned to

19

Righthaven “to the greatest extent permitted by law.” (Id.) This broad language impairs the

20

markets and interests of other licensees to which Righthaven could license its copyrighted works,

21

such as those that better serve markets in which Stephens Market is permitted to compete, and

22

especially in light of Righthaven’s infringement litigation arrangement with Stephens Media

23

evinced in Exhibit A §§ 3-5, and unchanged by the “Clarification.”

24

Moreover, under the “Clarification,” Righthaven’s unilateral use of the assigned

25

copyright would constitute a material breach of the Agreement, allowing Stephens Media to seek

26
27
28

(888) 667-1113

injunctive relief against Righthaven for using the copyright that it ostensibly owns. (Exh. B § 1.)
Such an extreme limitation by the assignor of a copyright is inimical to ownership of a copyright,
yet in a desperate attempt to retain the right to extort money from NewsBlaze (and hundreds of
-7-

Case 2:11-cv-00720-RCJ -GWF Document 6

Filed 06/16/11 Page 8 of 17

1

other defendants), Righthaven dishonestly insists that it is the owner of the assigned Stephens

2

Media copyrights. (Exh. B § 3.) This dishonesty must not be rewarded.

3

Stephens Media’s $1.00-per-year license and royalty fee (Exh. B § 1) is also misleading.

4

While a nominal fee for licensing back the copyright Stephens Media originally assigned to

5

Righthaven, this sum is vastly outweighed by the revenues Stephens Media receives from

6

Righthaven’s litigation on the assigned copyright, as the Agreement – unaltered by the

7

“Clarification” in this respect – entitles Stephens Media to 50% of any recovery Righthaven

8

obtains from litigation. (Exh. A § 5). With all of the components taken together, Stephens Media

9

assigns its copyright to Righthaven and pays $1.00 in order to receive 50% of Righthaven’s

10

litigation recovery.2 Based on what little public information is available about Righthaven’s

11

settlements, Stephens Media’s recovery entitlement per copyright assignment has been orders of

12

magnitude greater than $1.3 Indeed, without the recovery clause in § 5 of the Agreement (Exh.

13

A. § 5), this entire arrangement would fail to be profitable for Stephens and Righthaven and

14

make no sense for either party, as Stephens assigns only copyrights that have been – or it

15

believes have been – infringed. (See Exh. A. § 3.) It makes no sense for Stephens Media to

16

assign only its infringed copyrights to Righthaven, just to license them back and give Righthaven

17

the sole “right” to sue for infringement,4 unless Righthaven’s only purpose is to sue on these

18

assigned copyrights.

19

Righthaven and Stephens Media also used the “Clarification” to amend the reversion

20

provisions of its Agreement. Instead of allowing Stephens Media to have a complete reversion

21

of the copyright (Exh. A § 8), the “Clarification” allows Stephens Media to, at any time, give

22

Righthaven 14 days notice that it will repurchase the previously assigned copyright for $10.

23

(Exh. B § 2.) What’s more, upon exercising this option, Stephens Media must repay Righthaven

24

the costs Righthaven had undertaken to pursue infringement actions on that assigned copyright.

Civ. P. 54(d)(2).

The right to sue for copyright infringement is not one of the exclusive copyright rights provided under 17 U.S.C. §

1

(Id.) This revised Section 8.2 goes into considerable detail governing how Righthaven will be

2

compensated and disputes settled in the event of Stephens Media exercising its unilateral right to

3

repurchase its assigned copyright from Righthaven, even at the cost of terminating Righthaven’s

4

pending litigation (id.) – a profound issue that belies Righthaven’s claim as the true, legal and

5

beneficial owner of the assigned copyrights.

6

Operating together, sections 1 and 2 of the “Clarification” make it clear that Stephens

7

Media retains full ownership of the copyrights that Righthaven claims to own. (Exh. B §§ 1 and

8

2.) If Righthaven wants to exploit or otherwise license the assigned copyright, it must give

9

Stephens Media 30 days’ notice before doing so. (Exh. B § 1.) Yet, once given notice of

10

Righthaven’s intent to use the copyright it supposedly owns, Stephens Media may exercise its

11

rights under new § 8.1 to repurchase the copyright with 14 days’ notice and the payment of $10.

12

This creates a loop where, if Righthaven were to even try to use Stephens Media’s assigned

13

copyrights for a purpose other than litigation, Stephens Media could (and certainly would) snatch

14

them back before Righthaven could actually use them. Righthaven’s and Stephens Media’s

15

characterization of this arrangement as “ownership” is beyond bizarre, and reveals their intent to

16

call an unlawful assignment of the right to sue “ownership” in an effort to misdirect the Court.

17

Substantively, this is not a non-exclusive license, but an exclusive license to Stephens

18

Media. This mislabeled exclusive license permits Stephens Media to use the assigned copyright

19

“to the greatest extent permitted by law” (id.) up to and until the time Righthaven uses or

20

licenses the copyright for a purpose other than infringement litigation. (Id.) Should Righthaven

21

provide Stephens Media notice that it intends to use the copyright for non-litigation purposes,

22

though, Stephens Media can buy back its rights before anyone else can use the copyrights

23

supposedly owned by Righthaven. (Exh. B §§ 1 and 2.) Sybersound, 517 F.3d at 1150-51

ii. Taken Together, the Terms of Rightaven’s Agreement and

2

“Clarification” Show that Righthaven is not the Owner of the Assigned

Copyrights, but has Merely been Assigned a Right to Sue.

4

Righthaven’s and Stephens Media’s “Clarification” describes Righthaven as the

5

copyright “owner,” but it is a word without meaning in this circumstance. (Exh. B § 3.) Just as a

6

child that lacks understanding of the world around her may call a dog a “cat,” that does not make

it so. Righthaven and Stephens Media have misidentified Righthaven as the owner of Stephens

8

Media’s assigned copyrights in § 3 of the “Clarification” (id.). This characterization of

9

Righthaven as an owner is inaccurate in light of the excessive restrictions on Righthaven’s use of

10

the assigned copyrights contained within the Agreement (Exh. A) and amplified in the

“Clarification” (Exh. B).

It is not uncommon for courts to encounter restrictive agreements that purport to transfer

13

ownership of a copyright but, in reality, convey no such right. In Lahiri v. Universal Music &

14

Video Distribution Corporation, 606 F.3d 1216, 1222 (9th Cir. 2010) the appeals court found

15

that a settlement agreement purportedly recognizing a party in the litigation as an “owner” of a

16

copyright was too restrictive to convey such a right, holding that “[t]he record demonstrates [the

17

attorney] misled the district court by use of a settlement agreement that deceptively used

18

ownership language, but did not convey or recognize [the assignee’s ownership].”

19

language should be of great instructive value for this Court, as the record in this case

20

demonstrates the same thing.

This

21

Similarly, in Nafal v. Carter, the court held that the plaintiff’s description in the putative

22

assignment as a “co-owner” was not dispositive of the plaintiff’s ownership rights. 540 F. Supp.

23

2d 1128, 1141 (C.D. Cal. 2007). Instead, the court held that the relevant test to determine proper

24

ownership of a copyright was “Whether an agreement transfers rights that are exclusive or

25

nonexclusive is governed by the substance of what was given to the licensee and not the label

26
27

that the parties put on the agreement.” Id. at 1141-42, citing Althin v. W. Suburban Kidney Ctr.,
874 F. Supp. 837, 843 (N.D. Ill. 1994).

1

In Nafal, the document allegedly giving the plaintiff an ownership interest in the

2

copyright prohibited him from “exercising any decision-making authority over almost every

3

portion of the License Agreement.” 540 F. Supp. 2d at 1142. Accordingly, the court found that

4

Nafal was not the owner of the work, lacked Article III standing to pursue a copyright

5

infringement claim, and disposed of the case at summary judgment. Id. at 1144. Similarly, in

6

Althin, the trial court found that the plaintiff company lacked standing to bring its copyright

7

infringement claims. 874 F. Supp. at 837. Upon review, the court found that the assignment

8

agreement that putatively made the company an exclusive copyright right holder merely

9

conveyed a non-exclusive license to the plaintiff company. Id. Specifically, the court found that

10

the rights transferred by the parties’ agreement under the 1976 Copyright Act were “governed by

11

the substance of what was given to the licensee and not the label that the parties put on the

12

agreement.” Id. As the licensor gave the licensee no right to transfer or assign the license

13

agreement, with only a very narrow exception, the court held that Althin did not acquire

14

sufficient rights to have standing to enforce them against others’ infringement, and thus

15

dismissed the case on the defendant’s Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) Motion to Dismiss. Id.

16

As set forth above, Righthaven has extraordinarily limited rights for a copyright “owner.”

17

Righthaven’s fundamental rights to dispose of its copyrights are so limited and crippled that

18

cannot even use them for non-litigation purposes without seeking Stephens Media’s approval,

19

lest it “materially breach” its Agreement. (Exh. B § 1.) Whenever Stephens Media wishes, with

20

minimal notice, it may, without opposition, repurchase its assigned copyrights for $10 apiece.

21

(Exh. B § 2.) As is apparent from the Agreement, the only thing Righthaven has any authority to

22

do is to pursue infringement litigation. (Exh. A §§ 3-5.)

23

A number of provisions in the Agreement that are not affected by the “Clarification”

24

further deny Righthaven ownership of the copyright, and reserve rights to Stephens Media far

25

beyond those due to a non-exclusive licensee.

26

Righthaven, Stephens Media is entitled to:

(Exh. A § 9.3.) This provision entitles Stephens Media, putatively the non-exclusive licensee of
the assigned copyrights under the “Clarification”, to mortgage the copyrights ostensibly owned
by Righthaven.

Thus, despite Righthaven being the apparent owner of these copyrights,

Stephens Media is entitled to use them as security for funding and other financial obligations.
This is inconsistent with the tale that Rightaven now weaves before this Court.
Stephens Media retains a number of other rights in the copyrights Righthaven claims to
own. In Agreement § 3.3 (id. § 3.3), Stephens Media retains the right to reassign the copyright,
despite Righthaven’s ownership, if Righthaven declines to sue for its infringement.

Righthaven was the sole and true owner of the assigned copyright, Stephens Media would have
no such rights, yet this section of the Agreement gives Stephens Media the right to reassign a
copyright that it insists is owned by Righthaven. (Id.) Righthaven further reveals the flimsiness
of its “ownership” in Agreement § 3.4, in which it does not even have the exclusive right to
conduct litigation, and grants Stephens Media – a mere non-exclusive licensee under the
“Clarification,” which normally would not have standing to sue for infringement – the right to
pursue infringement litigation on its own, without Righthaven. (Id. § 3.4.)
In sum, all of Righthaven’s rights to the copyrights assigned to it by Stephens Media are
completely beholden to Stephens Media’s unfettered whims: From Righthaven’s ability to
exploit or license the work to a party other than Stephens Media and Stephens Media’s right to
re-purchase any assigned copyright for $10 without Righthaven having any ability to oppose, to
Righthaven’s sole pre-authorized use of the assigned copyright being for copyright infringement
under Agreement §§ 3.1-3.4 and Stephens Media’s ability to pursue its own copyright
infringement lawsuits. Stephens Media’s rights and privileges permeate the Agreement and
“Clarification” so completely and thoroughly that Righthaven’s “ownership” of the assigned
copyright is little more than a cruel joke at NewsBlaze’s expense (and the expense of hundreds

2

poor souls who have paid Righthaven its extortionate demands).

3

To the extent this Court must examine this Agreement, and correct it as Righthaven has

4

encouraged the Court to do in § 15.1 of its Agreement (id. § 15.1) in order to effect the parties’

5

manifest intent, it should find that it is nothing more than a vehicle to unlawfully transfer the

6

right to sue, and no other rights, under the guise of copyright ownership. Yet, Righthaven’s

7

manifest intent, evidenced in its operating agreement, is to do nothing but register copyrights to

8

create the appearance of ownership and then sue for their infringement. Righthaven’s operating

9

agreement, in its complete and redacted form submitted, is contained in the public record as an

10

exhibit to a filing in Righthaven LLC v. DiBiase, Case No. 2:10-cv-01343 (D. Nev. Apr. 17,

11

2011) (Doc. # 51). A true and correct copy of excerpts therefrom, containing sections 3.2 and

12

19.4, is attached as Exhibit C.

13

In relevant part, § 3.2(d) and (e) state that Righthaven’s purpose will be to register

14

copyrights it “obtains” – flimsily, as seen in the Agreement – and use them as the basis for

15

infringement litigation; Righthaven’s intent was never to rightfully own or productively use the

16

obtained copyrights. (Exh. C § 3.2.) Righthaven even foresaw the problems addressed in this

17

Motion and by this District in Democratic Underground.

18

agreement identifies the prevailing unlawfulness of obtaining the bare right to sue for copyright

19

infringements, and, in a roundabout way, disclosed it as a risk that “the willingness of consumers

20

to understand and agree to the assignment and license-back structure that is inherent in the

21

Company’s business structure may not be consistent or even prevalent” (Exh. C § 19.4(d))

22

(emphasis added).

Section 19.4(d) of its operating

23

Indeed, the Agreement and its “Clarification” haphazardly consider Righthaven’s ability

24

to use and protect its copyright rights in all arenas except its meticulously detailed scheme to

25

pursue infringement litigation on the assigned copyrights in Agreement §§ 3-5. (Exh. A. §§ 3-5.)

The very inclusion of § 15.1 (id. § 15.1) in the Agreement, and its retention in the
“Clarification,” demonstrates that Righthaven and Stephens Media knew their arrangement was a
sham, yet they couldn’t find a way to make the Righthaven model work – predominantly because

such operations are prohibited by Silvers and other law in this Circuit – and want the Court to

2

change the parties’ agreement to effectuate its unlawful scheme. Not only is the Agreement and

3

“Clarification” between Stephens Media and Righthaven unlawful, so too is the parties’ intent –

4

to transfer the right to sue to Righthaven, with no other rights – and the Court cannot cure what

5

ails Righthaven and its business model.

6

The operation of this Agreement and its “Clarification” is nothing more than the transfer

7

of an accrued right to sue without any exclusive rights. This practice has been held unlawful in

8

every jurisdiction to consider it, including the controlling Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

Hyperquest, Inc. v. N’Site Solutions, Inc., 632 F.3d 377, 383 (7th Cir. 2011); U.S. v. Chalupnik,

13

Sybersound, 517 F.3d at 1144. No matter what Righthaven calls the rights it supposedly obtains,

14

substantive analysis reveals them to be little more than the bare right to sue – something that not

15

only is not provided for in 17 U.S.C. § 106, but has been specifically held to be unlawful in case

16

after case, and runs directly contrary to the Copyright Act’s entire purpose.

Righthaven has Willfully Deceived this Court, and its Complaint Should be

Righthaven fought mightily to keep this evidence from the public and from all defendants

20

in its legion of cases brought in this District. See generally Democratic Underground, Case No.

21

2:10-cv-1356. An examination of the document and its implications for Righthaven’s business

model make the reason plain – it reveals the unlawful nature of Righthaven’s actions before this

court and renders all of its lawsuits null and void. For this reason, the Court has an independent

justification for dismissing this case.

This Court has the inherent power to dismiss an action when a party has “willfully

1

inimical to the proper and equitable use of not only this Court’s resources, but the justice system

2

as a whole. There is little doubt, though, that this is exactly what Righthaven has done in this

3

case.

4

In the Agreement, Stephens Media retains an “exclusive license” to exploit the copyrights

5

allegedly assigned to Righthaven. (Exh. A § 7.2.) Righthaven has no right to receive royalties

6

for the copyrighted work’s use, other than the recovery it is entitled to from litigation;

7

additionally, Righthaven specifically gives Stephens Media an unspecified – but expansive5 –

8

exclusive license to exploit the copyrights. (Id.) The extent to which Righthaven putatively owns

9

the copyright is further undermined by Stephens Media’s right to reversion, which allows it to

10

take back the copyright at almost any time (Id. § 8.)

11

Meanwhile, in Righthaven’s Complaint, it deceptively claims to be the “owner” of the

12

copyrighted work (Doc. # 1 ¶¶ 11, 23) and avers to have the exclusive rights to reproduce the

13

work, create derivatives of the copyrighted work, distribute copies of the work and publicly

14

display the work under 17 U.S.C. § 106. (Doc. # 1 ¶¶ 30-33.) All of these claims are clearly

15

contradicted by Section 7.2 of the Agreement, which makes it clear that Righthaven has no rights

16

to use the work for any purpose other than litigation, and is assigned the copyright solely to coat

17

its lawsuits with the veneer of legitimacy. (Exh. A §§ 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 7.1, 7.2.)
Moreover, the Agreement is clear that Stephens Media is an interested party in this

18
19

litigation.

20

Righthaven’s recovery in its lawsuits, including this one. Yet, Righthaven has failed to disclose

21

Stephens Media as an interested party in this case as required by Local Rule 7.1-1. (Doc. # 2.) In

22

Democratic Underground, this District stated that if Stephens Media’s recovery of 50% of

23

litigation proceeds minus costs does not create a pecuniary interest under Local Rule 7.1-1, this

24

District “isn’t sure what would.” Case No. 2:10-cv-01356 (Doc. # 116 at 15:2-18). Furthermore,

25

this District issued an Order to Show Cause for Righthaven to explain why it should not be liable

1

The Agreement embodied in Exhibit A defines the full scope of Stephens Media’s

2

relationship with Righthaven, as its “Clarification” is ineffective in this case, rendering any

3

analysis of an individual copyright assignment superfluous. It is clear from the Agreement that

4

whatever rights Righthaven does have from Stephens Media are insufficient to lawfully bring its

5

lawsuit against these Defendants (and others as well), and that it lacks standing to do so.

6

Righthaven willfully hid this information from the Court, and when one party discovered it,

7

Righthaven fought extensively to keep the information from other Defendants. Now that it has

8

seen the light of day, and this Court has opportunity to gaze upon it, Righthaven’s deception

9

stands starkly revealed. This case must be dismissed.
Conclusion

10
11

Under the law of this Circuit and this District, Righthaven does not have the legal right to

12

pursue its copyright infringement claim in this case. As seen from Exhibits A and B, it has

13

acquired no rights from Stephens Media, and certainly not enough to claim its copyrights were

14

infringed upon. Evinced by excerpts from Righthaven’s operating agreement in Exhibit C, this

15

always was, and is, Righthaven’s intent in operating its unlawful lawsuit scheme. As such, it has

16

not suffered an injury cognizable by law, and its case is not properly before this Court.

17

Therefore, consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(h)(3), this Court should dismiss

18

Righthaven’s case against the Defendants.
