UNITED STATE DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
Case No. 15-60686-CIV-GAYLES
ROSE WISE,
Plaintiff
vs.
CITY OF LAUDERHILL,
Defendant.
/
DEFENDANT’S RESPONSE TO
MOTION TO WITHDRAW AS ATTORNEY FOR PLAINTIFF
Defendant, CITY OF LAUDERHILL (the “City”), respectfully provides the following as its
response to the Motion to Withdraw as Attorney for Plaintiff, D.E. 6:
1.

Had Plaintiff’s counsel conferred with the undersigned, we would have confirmed

that the City has no opposition to the Motion.
2.

However, given the prior history of this case (including, upon our information and

belief, the withdrawal of several prior attorneys for Plaintiff) as well as the pending Motion to
Dismiss filed by the City, D.E. 7, the City requests that any Order permitting the withdrawal of
counsel include specific deadlines for Plaintiff to: (1) retain new counsel if she desires, or provide
written notice of her intention to proceed pro se, and (2) respond to the Motion to Dismiss.
