PLAINTIFF’S MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF ITS RESPONSE IN
OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO QUASH SUBPOENA
AND VACATE ORDER GRANTING DISCOVERY AND DISMISS
PURSUANT TO FED. R. CIV. P. 45(c)(3)(A)
Plaintiff, Poplar Oaks, Inc. (“Plaintiff”), by and through undersigned counsel
opposes Defendant’s Motion to Quash Subpoena and Vacate Order Granting
Discovery and Dismiss Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P 45(c)(3)(A) (“Motion”), which
should be denied for the reasons set forth below.
I.

INTRODUCTION
Defendant begins his Motion by admitting he committed the infringement.

See CM/ECF 6-1 at p.1. Defendant goes on to seek various grounds for relief—
none of which have any merit. First, Defendant fails to assert a legally cognizable
reason to quash the third party subpoena under Fed. R. Civ. P. 45. Defendant fails
to recognize that Plaintiff must obtain the subpoena response in order for this case
to proceed. Second, Plaintiff’s complaint states a plausible claim for relief and
should not be dismissed. Third, the Court should deny Defendant’s request for a
protective order because Defendant failed to satisfy Rule 26.

Indeed, the

allegations in Plaintiff’s complaint are not embarrassing or annoying within the
meaning of the rule. For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests this
Court deny the subject Motion and allow Plaintiff to obtain the subpoena response
from Defendant’s ISP so this case can proceed.

II.

ARGUMENT
A. The Third Party Subpoena Should Not Be Quashed
Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(3) provides that a court must modify or quash a

subpoena that fails to allow a reasonable time to comply; requires a person to
comply beyond the geographical limits specified in Rule 45(c); requires disclosure
of privileged or other protected matter, if no exception or waiver applies; or,
subjects a person to undue burden. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(3)(A)(i-iv). The Rule
also provides for circumstances in which a court may modify or quash a
subpoena. These circumstances are when the subpoena requires disclosure of trade
secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information; or
disclosure of certain expert opinions. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(3)(B)(i-ii). “The
party seeking to quash the subpoena bears the burden of demonstrating that the
requirements of [Rule 45] are satisfied.” Malibu Media, LLC v. John Does 1-18,
2014 WL 229295, at *6 (D.N.J. 2014).
i.

The Subpoena Does Not Place an Undue Burden on Defendant

Defendant argues that the subpoena places an undue burden on him because it
requires him to “disclose confidential and proprietary information.” Motion, at p.
3.

First, the subpoena cannot place an undue burden on Defendant because

Defendant is not required to produce anything.

“[A] party generally cannot

challenge a third-party subpoena based on a theory of undue burden.” Malibu
5

Case 2:14-cv-07901-SDW-SCM Document 8 Filed 03/23/15 Page 6 of 13 PageID: 106

Media, LLC v. John Does 1-18, 2014 WL 229295, at *7 (D.N.J. 2014). “Because
[Defendant] is not the party directed to respond to the subpoena, no action is
required of him, he cannot maintain that the subpoena creates an undue burden on
him.” Malibu Media, LLC v. Reynolds, 2013 WL 870618, at *6 (N.D. Ill. 2013).
See also, e.g., Malibu Media, LLC v. John Does 1–14, 2012 WL 6115653, at *2
(N.D. Ind. 2012) (“[A]ny argument that this subpoena imposes an undue burden on
Doe No. 12 fails because, as courts have consistently recognized, a subpoena
directed at an ISP does not require the defendant to produce anything”); Sunlust
Pictures, 2012 WL 3717768, at *2 (N.D. Ill. 2012) (“The subpoena does not
impose an undue burden on Doe because he is not the party directed to respond to
it.”). Here, the subpoena does not impose an undue burden on Defendant because
he is not required to respond to the subpoena.
Second, the subpoenaed information is neither confidential nor proprietary.
“[C]ourts have consistently held that ‘Internet subscribers do not have a reasonable
expectation of privacy in their subscriber information.’” Malibu Media, LLC v.
John Does No. 1-30, 2012 WL 6203697, at *4 (D.N.J. 2012) (quoting First Time
Videos v. Does 1-500, 276 F.R.D. 241, 247 (N.D. Ill. 2011)). “This is because
‘[I]nternet subscribers have already voluntarily conveyed their subscriber
information—name, address, and phone number to their [I]nternet [S]ervice
[P]rovider.’” Malibu Media, LLC v. John Does 1-18, 2014 WL 229295, at *7
6

Case 2:14-cv-07901-SDW-SCM Document 8 Filed 03/23/15 Page 7 of 13 PageID: 107

(D.N.J. 2014) (quoting Malibu Media, LLC v. John Does 1-15, 2012 WL 3089383,
at *8 (E.D. Pa 2012)).

Here, Plaintiff seeks only the Defendant’s name and

address—nonprivileged information that Defendant has already provided to his
ISP. Because the subpoena seeks nonprivileged information and places no undue
burden on Defendant, the Motion to quash should be denied.
ii.

Arguments that Go to the Merits of Plaintiff’s Complaint have no
Bearing on a Motion to Quash.

Notwithstanding his apparent admission on the first page of his Motion,
Defendant makes several generalized assertions that the subscriber is not
necessarily the infringer. Motion, at p. 8. Regardless, arguments that go to the
merits of Plaintiff’s complaint are premature and have no bearing on a motion to
quash. “If Doe is contesting whether he actually downloaded entire files, such
arguments go to the merits of the action and are ‘not relevant as to the validity or
enforceability of a subpoena, but rather should be presented and contested once
parties are brought properly into the suit.’” Malibu Media, LLC v. Doe, 2014 WL
1228383 (N.D. Ill. 2014) (quoting First Time Videos, LLC v. Does 1–500, 276
F.R.D. 241, 251 (N.D. Ill. 2011). See also Malibu Media, LLC v. John Does 1-14,
287 F.R.D. 513, 517 (N.D. Ind. 2012) (defenses and denials of liability “do not
address the propriety vel non of the subpoenas” and are therefore “irrelevant and
premature.”).
Additionally, Defendant prematurely argues that this Court lacks personal
7

Case 2:14-cv-07901-SDW-SCM Document 8 Filed 03/23/15 Page 8 of 13 PageID: 108

jurisdiction over Defendant, asserting “Plaintiff does not even intend to serve the
summons upon the defendant until they learn the name and address of defendant.”
Motion, at p. 6. Defendant ignores that the fact that Plaintiff cannot serve process
upon the Defendant until after Defendant is identified. Indeed, Plaintiff “cannot
meet its service obligation under Fed. R. Civ. P. 4 without the requested
discovery.” TCYK, LLC v. Does 1-47, 2013 WL 4805022, at *5 (S.D. Ohio
2013). In any event, Defendant’s assertion is not a legally cognizable reason to
quash a subpoena under Fed. R. Civ. P. 45. “[L]ack of jurisdiction [assertions are]
premature and irrelevant to the motion for expedited discovery. . . .” Safety Point
Productions, LLC v. Does 1-57, 2013 WL 1398585, at *1 (E.D. Tenn. 2013)
(denying defendant’s motion to quash).
iii.

Plaintiff Needs the Subpoenaed Information to Continue with this
Case

Plaintiff “cannot meet its service obligation under Fed.R.Civ.P. 4 without
the requested discovery.” TCYK, LLC v. Does 1-47, 2013 WL 4805022, at *5
(S.D. Ohio 2013). Without the identifying the internet subscriber, Plaintiff has no
way to protect its copyrights against pervasive anonymous online infringement.
If the Court were to quash the subpoena as the Putative Defendants
urge, it would be impossible for [Plaintiff] to protect its copyright
against internet infringers. . . . Even if, as the Putative Defendants
contend, someone else used their internet connections to copy and
distribute [Plaintiff’s] films, the identity of IP address holders is
relevant to [Plaintiff]'s claims: it can provide a useful starting point for
identifying the actual infringer. Thus, the Court finds that the
8

Case 2:14-cv-07901-SDW-SCM Document 8 Filed 03/23/15 Page 9 of 13 PageID: 109

relevance of the IP address holders' identity outweighs the burden of
its subpoena.
See e.g. Malibu Media, LLC v. John Does 1-6, 2013 WL 2150679 at *5
(N.D. Ill. 2013) (denying motion to quash) (citations omitted).
Further, Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 provides for broad discovery, and the identity of
the subscriber is clearly relevant under the given standard.
Rule 26 authorizes broad discovery, including discovery that “appears
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1). Therefore, even if discovery later
reveals that it was someone other than the subscriber who violated
plaintiff's copyright, the subpoenaed information (i.e., the subscriber's
contact information) is likely to lead to the discovery of admissible
information, i.e., the identity of the actual alleged infringer.
Breaking Glass Pictures v. John Does 1-32, 2014 WL 467137, at *4 (S.D. Ohio
2014) (denying motion to quash.) “Relevance is a broad concept at the discovery
phase . . . The identity of the customers associated with the Alleged IP addresses is
relevant under this standard . . . The subpoenas to the ISP, therefore, are a proper
use of discovery.” Patrick Collins, Inc. v. John Does 1-9, 2012 WL 4321718 at *4
(C.D. Ill. 2012). See also, e.g., Raw Films, Ltd. v. John Does 1-15, 2012 WL
1019067, at *6 (E.D. Pa. 2012) (same); Malibu Media, LLC v. John Does 1-15,
2012 WL 3089383 at *9 (E.D. Pa. 2012) (same); Malibu Media, LLC v. John Does
1-6, 2013 WL 2150679 at *5 (N.D. Ill. 2013) (same); Malibu Media, LLC v. John
Does No. 1-30, 2012 WL 6203697 at *4 (D.N.J. 2012) (same).

9

Case 2:14-cv-07901-SDW-SCM Document 8 Filed 03/23/15 Page 10 of 13 PageID: 110

Because Defendant has failed to state a legally cognizable reason under Rule
45, this Court should not quash the subpoena.
B. Plaintiff’s Complaint Should Not Be Dismissed
Plaintiff’s complaint should not be dismissed because it states a plausible
claim for relief. A prima facie claim of copyright infringement consists of two
elements: (1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying of constituent
elements of the work that are original. Feist Publ’ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co.,
Inc., 499 U.S. 340, 361 (1991). Plaintiff’s complaint sufficiently alleges a claim
for copyright infringement against Defendant:
33. Plaintiff is the owner of the copyright which covers an original
work of authorship.
34. By using BitTorrent, Defendant copied and distributed the
constituent elements of the copyrighted work.
35. Plaintiff did not authorize, permit or consent to Defendant’s
distribution of its work.
Complaint [CM/ECF 1], at ¶¶ 33-35.
Indeed, numerous courts have held that similar complaints alleging direct
copyright infringement though the BitTorrent protocol state plausible claims for
relief. See e.g. Good Man Prods., Inc. v. Doe, 2015 WL 310603, at *2 (M.D. Fla.
2015) (“Plaintiff has made a prima facie showing of copyright infringement.”);
Countryman Nevada, LLC v. Pitts, 2014 WL 7178077, at *2 (M.D. Fla. 2014)
(“the district courts that have been presented with the same facts and circumstances
10

Case 2:14-cv-07901-SDW-SCM Document 8 Filed 03/23/15 Page 11 of 13 PageID: 111

presented here are nearly unanimous in concluding that such factual allegations are
sufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.”); Malibu Media, LLC v.
Doe, 2013 WL 5876192, at *2 (E.D. Wis. 2013) (“plaintiff has alleged enough to
at least proceed to discovery and determine whether it can prove that it was the
defendant who used the Internet connection to distribute the movies.”).
Further, Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s complaint fails to allege this Court
has personal jurisdiction over Defendant: “[w]ithout such allegations, the
complaint cannot be sustained[.]” Motion, at p. 6. This is simply not true. Plaintiff
has sufficiently alleged that “Plaintiff used proven IP address geolocation
technology . . . to ensure that Defendant’s acts of copyright infringement occurred .
. . within this District [.]” See Complaint [CM/ECF 1], at ¶ 5.
Plaintiff’s complaint states plausible claims for relief and should not be
dismissed.
C. A Protective Order is Unnecessary
Defendant’s several requests to remain anonymous are tantamount to a
request for a protective order under Rule 26. Motion, p. 2. Under Rule 26(c)
protective orders may issue “for good cause . . . to protect a party or person from
annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense[.]” Fed. R.
Civ. P. 26(c)(1).

To demonstrate good cause “the movant has the burden of

showing the injury ‘with specificity.’

In other words, the party seeking the
11

Case 2:14-cv-07901-SDW-SCM Document 8 Filed 03/23/15 Page 12 of 13 PageID: 112

protective order must . . . demonstrat[e] a particular need for protection. Broad
allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific examples or articulated reasoning,
do not satisfy the Rule 26(c) test.” Trinos v. Quality Staffing Servs. Corp., 250
F.R.D. 696, 698 (S.D. Fla. 2008) (citations omitted).
Here, Defendant has asserted nothing more than a broad unsubstantiated
potential harm if his identity is released to Plaintiff and subsequently to the public.
The allegations contained in Plaintiff’s complaint, that Defendant downloaded a
mainstream Hollywood action movie, are not embarrassing. Indeed, it is “the rare
civil lawsuit in which a defendant is not accused of behavior of which others may
disapprove.” Malibu Media, LLC v. John Does 1-18, 2014 WL 229295, at *8
(D.N.J. 2014).
And, to the extent that Defendant asserts that he is “fears retaliation by
Plaintiff,” Defendant has not and cannot point to single incident of “retaliation.”
Motion, at p. 2.

Defendant’s false claims of “persistent phone calls” are

unsubstantiated and do not warrant the issuance of a protective order. Indeed,
Plaintiff has not contacted Defendant—and cannot contact Defendant—because
Defendant is represented by counsel. Defendant’s accusations are not only untrue
but they are insufficient to warrant a protective order under Rule 26.
