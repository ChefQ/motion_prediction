Case 1:16-cv-01300-SS Document 6 Filed 12/12/16 Page 7 of 35

Plaintiffs, providers of women’s reproductive healthcare, seek a temporary restraining
order, or alternatively a preliminary injunction, to preserve the status quo and prevent irreparable
harm to themselves and their patients from Defendant’s enforcement of the Department of State
Health Services’ (“DSHS”) amendments to and interpretations of 25 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 1.1311.137, published in the Texas Register at 41 Tex. Reg. 9732-41 (the “Regulation”) on December
9, 2016, and scheduled to take effect December 18, 2016. The Regulation is unconstitutionally
vague and would bizarrely require healthcare facilities providing women with ectopic pregnancy
surgery, miscarriage management procedures, or abortions, to ensure a funeral ritual for their
patients’ embryos or fetal tissue, in the form of burial or scattering ashes, with or without their
patients’ consent, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
Additionally, absent injunctive relief, DSHS threatens to make available to the general public the
names of numerous Texas women who obtain abortions. Plaintiffs respectfully request the
Court to act by the Regulation’s effective date of December 18, 2016. 1
BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs are healthcare providers who for decades have provided a wide variety of care
to Texas women. Declaration of Amy Hagstrom Miller (“Hagstrom Miller Decl.”) (attached
hereto as App. A) ¶¶ 1-2; Declaration of Lendol L. (“Tad”) Davis, M.D. (“Davis Decl.”) (attached
hereto as App. B) ¶¶ 5-6. This includes abortion care. Hagstrom Miller Decl. ¶ 1; Davis Decl. ¶ 6.
On June 27, 2016, the Supreme Court decided Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, 136
S. Ct. 2292 (2016). The Court struck down two provisions of Texas House Bill 2 (“HB 2”) of

Plaintiffs’ counsel hereby certify, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b), that simultaneously with the
present filing, they are contacting Defendant’s counsel in proceedings ongoing in this District in
Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, No. 14-CV-00284-LY, by email and telephone, to advise
them of Plaintiffs’ motion and provide copies of the papers. Plaintiffs are prepared to attend a
status conference at the Court’s and Defendant’s counsel’s earliest availability.

Case 1:16-cv-01300-SS Document 6 Filed 12/12/16 Page 8 of 35

2013, which had imposed burdensome and medically-unjustified requirements on abortion
providers, including mandating that physicians who perform abortions obtain admitting privileges
at a local hospital. Id. at 2310-18. These requirements had closed abortion clinics, including many
run by Plaintiffs, throughout the state. Id. at 2312-13. The Court also struck down the
implementing regulations of those provisions, which DSHS had written. Id. at 2314-15.
Four days after the Supreme Court ruling, on July 1 of this year, DSHS published in the
Texas Register a proposed version of the challenged Regulation. 41 Tex. Reg. 4772-78 (attached
hereto as App. G).2 In that publication, under the heading “Public Benefit,” DSHS stated, “the
public benefit anticipated as a result of adopting and enforcing these rules will be enhanced
protection of the health and safety of the public.” 41 Tex. Reg. at 4773. On September 30, after a
comment period and public hearing, DSHS withdrew the then-proposed Regulation, and issued a
new proposed Regulation, containing identical text, but a longer explanatory preamble. 41 Tex.
Reg. 7659-65 (attached hereto as App. H). There, under the heading “Public Benefit,” DSHS
stated, “the public benefit anticipated as a result of adopting and enforcing these rules will be
enhanced protection of the health and safety of the public by ensuring that the disposition methods
specified in the rules continue to be limited to methods that prevent the spread of disease.” 41
Tex. Reg. at 7660. DSHS again received comments and held a public hearing.
On December 9, DSHS had the adopted Regulation, with some amendments made, finally
published in the Texas Register. 41 Tex. Reg. 9709-41 (attached to Compl. as Ex. 1). There, under

DSHS had, by then, developed a history of retaliating against the Whole Woman’s Health
plaintiffs. DSHS’ unlawful actions have included attempting, late last year, to enforce enjoined
sections of HB 2 against Plaintiff Reproductive Services, Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt,
No. 14-CV-00284-LY, (W.D. Tex. Aug 17, 2015) (ECF Doc. No. 234), and earlier this year,
issuing a baseless statement of deficiencies against Plaintiff Austin Women’s Health Center, which
it withdrew after receiving a strongly-worded letter from counsel, Davis Decl. ¶ 34 and Ex. B.

Case 1:16-cv-01300-SS Document 6 Filed 12/12/16 Page 9 of 35

the heading “Public Benefit,” DSHS states, “the public benefit anticipated as a result of adopting
and enforcing these rules will be the continued protection of the health and safety of the public by
ensuring that the disposition methods specified in the rules continue to be limited to methods that
prevent the spread of disease. Additional public benefit will be realized in bringing up-to-date the
department’s rules to reflect the Legislature’s articulated policy objectives of respect for life and
protecting the dignity of the unborn.” 41 Tex. Reg. at 9732.
The medical care Plaintiffs provide generates various kinds of “special waste from health
care-related facilities.” 25 Tex. Admin. Code § 1.131. This includes tissue from medical
procedures including, but not limited to, abortion. Hagstrom Miller Decl. ¶¶ 5-6; Davis Decl. ¶ 11.
Under current Texas law, healthcare facilities are generally allowed to use any of seven
methods to dispose of tissue. 25 Tex. Admin. Code § 1.136. These seven methods apply both to
“human materials removed during surgery” and other procedures, and to “the products of
spontaneous or induced human abortion.” Id. § 1.136(a)(4)(A), (a)(4)(B); Ex. 2 to Compl. at 2024. The method generally used by Plaintiffs is incineration followed by disposition in a sanitary
landfill. Hagstrom Miller Decl. ¶ 5; Davis Decl. ¶ 14. This method is well within the standard of
care. Declaration of Diane Schecter, M.D. (“Schecter Decl.”) (attached hereto as App. C) ¶¶ 1214. Occasionally, Plaintiffs’ patients choose a funeral method of disposition, such as cremation or
burial, for a lost pregnancy, and Plaintiffs refer those patients to funeral homes. Hagstrom Miller
Decl. ¶ 16; Davis Decl. ¶ 23. This is allowed under current law. 25 Tex. Admin. Code
§ 1.136(a)(4)(A)(ii)(III), (a)(4)(B)(i)(IV); Ex. 2 to Compl. at 21-22.
The Regulation makes four relevant changes to existing law. First, it creates a new defined
term, “fetal tissue,” which means, “[a] fetus, body parts, organs or other tissue from a
pregnancy. . . . [not including] the umbilical cord, placenta, gestational sac, blood or body fluids.”

3

Case 1:16-cv-01300-SS Document 6 Filed 12/12/16 Page 10 of 35

25 Tex. Admin. Code § 1.132(28). Second, it creates a separate “fetal tissue” sub-category both of
“[h]uman materials removed during surgery” and other procedures, and of the “products of
spontaneous or induced human abortion.” Id. § 1.136(a)(4)(A)(v), (a)(4)(B)(i). Third, it limits the
disposition of all “fetal tissue,” “regardless of the period of gestation,” (and therefore including
embryonic tissue, see Davis Decl. ¶ 15), to three methods: “interment,” “incineration followed by
interment,” and “steam disinfection followed by interment.” 25 Tex. Admin. Code
§ 1.136(a)(4)(A)(v), (a)(4)(B)(i). “[I]ncineration followed by deposition of the residue in a sanitary
landfill” is deleted from the list, as are several other methods Plaintiffs do not use. Ex. 2 to Compl.
at 21-22. Finally, the Regulation amends a number of definitions of methods of disposition.
“[I]nterment,” which under current law already includes “cremation” and “entombment, burial, or
placement in a niche,”3 will now additionally include “the process of cremation followed by
placement of the ashes in a niche, grave, or scattering of ashes as authorized by law, unless
prohibited by this subchapter.” 25 Tex. Admin. Code § 1.132(33); Ex. 2 to Compl. at 4.
“Cremation,” currently not defined in § 1.132, will now be “[t]he irreversible process of reducing
tissue or remains to ashes or bone fragments through extreme heat and evaporation. . . . includ[ing]
the process of incineration.” 25 Tex. Admin. Code § 1.132(18).4
Thus, the Regulation treats embryonic and fetal tissue differently than all other humanderived tissue, by mandating that it ultimately be disposed of by “interment”—that is, burial or
scattering ashes—with incineration or steam disinfection as an optional first step. Also, DSHS
3

Plaintiffs understand “entombment” and “placement in a niche” to be akin to burial, as that term
is commonly understood, in that these methods entail disposition into some kind of memorial
structure like a mausoleum, tomb, or columbarium. Plaintiffs collectively refer to “entombment,
burial, or placement in a niche” as “burial.”
4

The definition of “incineration” remains unchanged in relevant part: “That process of burning
SWFHCRF in an incinerator as defined in 30 TAC Chapter 101 under conditions in conformance
with standards prescribed in 30 TAC Chapter 111.” 25 Tex. Admin. Code § 1.132(32).
4

Case 1:16-cv-01300-SS Document 6 Filed 12/12/16 Page 11 of 35

avers that the Regulation prohibits depositing ashes from cremation or incineration in a landfill,
although this prohibition does not appear on the face of the Regulation. 41 Tex. Reg. at 9709.
LEGAL AUTHORITIES SUPPORTING THE MOTION
To merit a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction, the moving party must
show: (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a substantial threat that failure to
grant the injunction will result in irreparable injury to the moving party; (3) the threatened injury
outweighs any damages the injunction may cause defendant; and (4) the injunction is in the public
interest. Jackson Women’s Health Org. v. Currier, 760 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir. 2014).
I.

PLAINTIFFS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY LIKELY TO PREVAIL ON THE
MERITS OF THEIR CLAIMS.
A. The Regulation Invades the Personal Liberty Guaranteed by the Constitution.
1.

Liberty Includes the Right to Make Decisions About Pregnancy.

Due Process protects “all fundamental rights comprised within the term liberty.” Planned
Parenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 847 (1992) (quoting Whitney v. California, 274 U.S.
357, 373 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring)). Among these rights are “personal choices central to
individual dignity and autonomy, including intimate choices that define personal identity and
beliefs,” Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2597 (2015), such as “choices concerning
contraception, family relationships, procreation, . . . childrearing,” id. at 2599, and “medical
treatment,” Casey, 505 U.S. at 857. Such choices “are central to the liberty protected by the
Fourteenth Amendment.” Id. at 851. It is “the right of the individual, married or single, to be free
of unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the
decision whether to bear or beget a child.” Id. (quoting Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 453
(1972)).
The Court has further explained that its own “obligation is to define the liberty of all, not

5

Case 1:16-cv-01300-SS Document 6 Filed 12/12/16 Page 12 of 35

to mandate our own moral code,” and that “concept[s] of existence, of meaning, of the universe,
and of the mystery of human life[,] . . . [and] the attributes of personhood” may not be compelled
by the State. Casey, 505 U.S. at 850-51; accord Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 571 (2003); see
also id. at 577 (“[T]he fact that the governing majority in a State has traditionally viewed a
particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the
practice.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). “If there is any fixed star in our constitutional
constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics,
nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their
faith therein.” W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943).
The Regulation violates these basic constitutional principles, and infringes the rights of
women, by imposing burdensome requirements on miscarriage management, ectopic pregnancy
treatment, and abortion, in an effort to impose the State’s “own moral code” on women who seek
pregnancy-related medical care. Casey, 505 U.S. at 850.
2.

The Regulation Requires Searching Judicial Scrutiny.

Restrictions on the practice of abortion are unconstitutional where they impose an “undue
burden” on abortion access. Whole Woman’s Health, 136 S. Ct. at 2309 (quoting Casey, 505
U.S. at 878). The Constitution’s limits on government power to interfere with women seeking
treatment for miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy are at least as stringent as those regarding
abortion. See generally Casey, 505 U.S. at 851.
The undue burden standard “requires that courts consider the burdens a law imposes on
abortion access together with the benefits those laws confer.” Whole Woman’s Health, 136 S.
Ct. at 2309. A court must “consider[] the evidence in the record,” and “then weigh[] the asserted
benefits against the burdens.” Id. at 2310. Where a law fails to confer “benefits sufficient to
justify the burdens,” those burdens are “undue”—that is to say, unconstitutional. Id. at 2300.
6

Case 1:16-cv-01300-SS Document 6 Filed 12/12/16 Page 13 of 35

Applying the undue burden standard requires searching judicial scrutiny. Id. at 2310
(“[T]he Court . . . has placed considerable weight upon evidence and argument presented in
judicial proceedings”). In evaluating a restriction’s benefits and burdens, courts must rely on
record evidence, and not simply a State’s assertions about any purported benefits or burdens. Id.
at 2309-10 (explaining that, where “regulation of a constitutionally protected personal
liberty . . . is at issue,” the “less strict review” applicable to economic legislation is not
appropriate). The record must show a law actually “further[s]” the government’s asserted
interest, id. at 2310, and the State may not advance justifications for a law that are pretextual,
see Casey, 505 U.S. at 877, or absent from the legislative (or in this case, administrative) record,
see United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996) (“The justification must be genuine, not
hypothesized or invented post hoc in response to litigation.”); see also Veasey v. Abbott, 830
F.3d 216, 240-41 (5th Cir. 2016) (en banc) (shifting rationales offered in defense of a law can be
evidence of pretext).
3.

The Regulation Serves No Valid State Interest.

To survive scrutiny under the undue burden standard, a law that burdens abortion access
must, in reality, advance its purported purpose. E.g., Whole Woman’s Health, 136 S. Ct. at 2311
(“We have found nothing in Texas’ record evidence that shows that, compared to prior
law, . . . the new law advanced Texas’ legitimate interest in protecting women’s health.”); id. at
2311-12 (“[W]hen directly asked at oral argument whether Texas knew of a single instance in
which the new requirement would have helped even one woman obtain better treatment, Texas
admitted that there was no evidence in the record of such a case.”); id. at 2315 (“There is
considerable evidence in the record supporting the District Court’s findings indicating that the
statutory provision requiring all abortion facilities to meet all surgical-center standards does not
benefit patients and is not necessary.”); see also id. at 2314 (“The record contains nothing to
7

Case 1:16-cv-01300-SS Document 6 Filed 12/12/16 Page 14 of 35

suggest that H.B. 2 would be more effective than pre-existing Texas law at deterring
wrongdoers . . . from criminal behavior.”).
a. The Regulation Does Not Serve a Health Interest.
Here, DSHS asserts that the Regulation’s purpose is “the continued protection of the
health and safety of the public by ensuring that the disposition methods specified in the rules
continue to be limited to the methods that prevent the spread of disease.” 41 Tex. Reg. at 9732.
But there is no medical reason to require fetal or embryonic tissue be disposed of using different
methods from all other human tissue. Schecter Decl. ¶¶ 4, 12-17; Davis Decl. ¶ 16. This is
because there is no difference in the risk of the spread of disease between the two. Schecter Decl.
¶ 17; Davis Decl. ¶ 16. DSHS has even stated that the Regulation “is not intended to . . . reduce
risks to human health from environmental exposure.” 41 Tex. Reg. at 4773; see also 41 Tex.
Reg. at 9709 (“These rules provide a comparable level of protection to public health . . . .”). Cf.
Margaret S. v. Treen, 597 F. Supp. 636, 670 (E.D. La. 1984) (“There is no conceivable
justification . . . in terms of protecting maternal health” of requiring doctors to inform women
that they may choose burial or other methods of disposition after abortion), aff’d on other
grounds sub nom. Margaret S. v. Edwards, 794 F.2d 994 (5th Cir. 1986). Further, even after the
Regulation takes effect, disposition into a sanitary sewer will remain, as now, the most common
method of disposition of embryonic and fetal tissue, because most women handle miscarriage
and medication abortions at home. Schecter Decl. ¶ 18; Davis Decl. ¶¶ 20, 23. Were this a disease
risk, the Regulation would presumably have addressed it.
The Regulation’s failure to be “more effective than pre-existing Texas law” in furthering
its purpose, see Whole Woman’s Health, 136 S. Ct. at 2314, while imposing burdens on women
who seek miscarriage management, ectopic pregnancy treatment, or abortion, infra at 11-16, is
sufficient alone to invalidate it under the Constitution.

b. The Regulation is a Pretext for Restricting Abortion Access.
The Regulation’s failure to serve its stated interest, in light of the burdens it imposes on
women, see infra at 11-16, makes clear that the Regulation is merely a pretext for restricting
abortion access. See United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675, 2694 (2013) (A statute’s
“operation in practice confirms [its] purpose”); Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of
Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 535 (1993) (“[T]he effect of a law in its real operation is strong evidence
of its object.”). So does the Regulation’s history, including its timing, and DSHS’ shifting
rationales for enacting it. Supra at 1-3 and n. 2. See Veasey, 830 F.3d at 240-41. DSHS declined
to put its interest in the “dignity of the unborn” into the administrative record until after it had
twice proposed the Regulation and the final public comment period was closed.5 This interest is
clearly a rationale invented in anticipation of litigation, despite DSHS holding the Regulation out
to the public as a health measure. See United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533. Moreover, DSHS
does not even impose on actual human bodies the stringent conditions the Regulation imposes on
embryonic and fetal tissue. Notably, DSHS does not seek to regulate how human remains, nor
any kind of pathological waste other than “fetal tissue,” is disposed of, after being sent out of
Texas. Compare 25 Tex. Admin. Code § 181.2(b) (a burial transit permit is all that is required for
a funeral director to remove a body from the state), with 41 Tex. Reg. at 9711 (“With regard to
the issue of whether the rules are intended to apply to disposition across state lines, regardless of
where the disposition of waste occurs, the health care-related facility remains responsible for
ensuring that the fetal tissue disposition is in compliance with these rules.”) (emphasis added).
Moreover, the Regulation does not further any kind of interest the Supreme Court has

5

The State offered other, political motives for DSHS’ rulemaking, off the record. See Abbott
Correspondence (attached hereto as App. J); Smith Correspondence (attached hereto as App. K).

found valid. Casey affirmed an interest in “potential life,” which a state may further by means
“calculated to inform the woman’s free choice, not hinder it.” 505 U.S. at 876-78. Subsequently,
in Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 157-160 (2007), the Court confirmed that a state may ban
a second-trimester abortion method that appeared perilously close to infanticide, thus
“express[ing] respect for the dignity of human life.”6 But here, neither interest is actually furthered
by the Regulation.” There is no “potential life” after a miscarriage, abortion, or ectopic pregnancy.
See PPINK v. Commissioner, __ F. Supp. 3d __, No. 16-CV-763-TWP-DML, 2016 WL 3556914,
at *10 (S.D. Ind. June 30, 2016) (“[T]he Supreme Court’s recognition that the government has a
legitimate interest in potential life has not been extended by Gonzales nor any other case ‘to
imposing procedures taken after the pregnancy has been terminated’ like the fetal tissue
disposition provisions do. . . . [T]he consistency with which the Supreme Court ties the legitimate
interest to the potentiality of life . . . . suggests that it would not extend these principles to this
context where, following an abortion, such a potentiality is no longer present.” (citation omitted));
accord Margaret S. v. Edwards, 488 F. Supp. 181, 222 (E.D. La. 1980) (It is impermissible to
“equat[e] fetal remains with human remains.”). And though “the means chosen by the State to
further the interest in potential life must be calculated to inform the woman’s free choice, not
hinder it,” Casey, 505 at 877, the means the State has chosen here are compulsory and invasive.
The great majority of women who miscarry or decide to have an abortion do not choose the State’s
preferred option, Schecter Decl. ¶ 18, Hagstrom Miller Decl. ¶ 16, Davis Decl. ¶¶ 20-23. The
State cannot “express[] respect for the dignity of human life,” Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 157, by

This was but one of several interests the Court found promoted by the law at issue; others included
“the ethics and integrity of the medical profession” and the “public’s perception of the appropriate
role of a physician.” Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 157-160.

depriving women of their moral agency and compelling them to act in accordance with its own,
different beliefs about “the mystery of human life.” Casey, 505 U.S. at 851.7

The Regulation Burdens Women Seeking Pregnancy-Related Medical
Care.

The burdens the Regulation imposes fall into three categories: First, it forces funeral rituals
on women who have had an abortion, a miscarriage management procedure, or an ectopic
pregnancy surgery. Second, it threatens women’s health and safety by providing no safe harbor
for sending tissue to pathology or crime labs. Third, it adopts the same tactics as the admittingprivileges requirement struck down in HB 2—compelling abortion providers to maintain a
fragile, medically-unnecessary third-party relationship—to once again threaten abortion clinics’
ability to provide care and keep their doors open. This tactic also threatens to impose cost burdens
on women, especially those obtaining treatment for miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy.
a. The Law Unconstitutionally Forces Funeral Rituals onto Unwilling
Women.
The Regulation does not allow doctors to continue using the standard method of
disposition of medical tissue when disposing of embryonic or fetal tissue. Schecter Decl. ¶¶ 1215. Instead, it requires ultimate disposition of tissue be either burial or scattering ashes. Thus, the
Regulation requires treating embryonic or fetal tissue like human bodies, and by extension,
enforces the viewpoint that embryos are people. Declaration of the Reverend Dr. Debra W.
Haffner, D. Min., M. Div., M.P.H. (“Haffner Decl.”) (attached hereto as App. D) ¶¶ 7, 10;

7

DSHS suggests that women not be told about the Regulation. E.g., 41 Tex. Reg. at 9717 (“[T]he
rules . . . do not now impose, a requirement that a woman be informed of the method of disposition
or choose that method of disposition.”). Keeping women in the dark about the law is patronizing
and relies on offensive gender stereotypes. See J.E.B. v. Alabama ex. Rel. T.B., 511 U.S. 127 (1994)
(An “attitude of ‘romantic paternalism’ . . . put[s] women, not on a pedestal, but in a cage.”
(quoting Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 684 (1973) (plurality opinion))).

Case 1:16-cv-01300-SS Document 6 Filed 12/12/16 Page 18 of 35

Declaration of Valerie Peterson, Ed.D. (“Peterson Decl.”) (attached hereto as App. E) ¶¶ 8-12;
see also, e.g., 41 Tex. Reg. at 9720 (comments by Texas Catholic Conference stating that the
Regulation “afford[s] the same dignity and respect as any other human body”); id. (comments by
Texas Right to Life stating that the Regulation “recognize[s] fetal remains as human remains”).
Under current law, women can, and occasionally do, choose funeral disposition for a lost
pregnancy. Hagstrom Miller Decl. ¶ 16; Davis Decl. ¶ 23. Thus, the regulation, by definition, only
forces these funeral rituals onto women who would not otherwise choose them.
A woman’s views about when a developing human life attains the status of a person may
vary greatly based on her cultural and religious traditions and personal beliefs. See Haffner Decl.
¶¶ 7-8, 10; Peterson Decl. ¶¶ 12-13; Casey, 505 U.S. at 850 (“Men and women of good conscience
can disagree, and we suppose some always shall disagree, about the profound moral and spiritual
implications of terminating a pregnancy, even in its earliest stage.”); Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113,
159-62 (1973) (noting that “those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy,
and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus” about “the difficult question of when life
begins” and surveying different schools of thought). Likewise, views about the appropriate
disposition of embryonic or fetal tissue vary based on the same factors. See Haffner Decl. ¶ 9;
Peterson Decl. ¶¶ 8-12.
A woman has the right to decide for herself whether an embryo or fetal tissue is to be
imbued with the notion of personhood. See Casey, 505 U.S. at 851 (“At the heart of liberty is the
right to define one’s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and the mystery of
human life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they
formed under compulsion of the State.”); cf. Barnette, 319 U.S. at 642. Indeed, although there are
fewer areas of human life more tinged with a religious character than funeral rituals, see Haffner

12

Case 1:16-cv-01300-SS Document 6 Filed 12/12/16 Page 19 of 35

Decl. ¶¶ 9, 17, DSHS has made no attempt to accommodate the Regulation’s impact on women
who do not view an embryo to be a person, or whose religious beliefs teach that a funeral ritual for
a non-person would be burlesque and a mockery. Id. ¶¶ 17-18; Peterson Decl. ¶¶ 10-15; contra
Barr v. City of Sinton, 295 S.W.3d 287, 308 (Tex. 2009) (The “T[exas] R[eligious] F[reedom]
R[estoration] A[ct] requires that even when the government acts in furtherance of a compelling
interest, it must show that it used the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.”).
The Regulation replaces the right “at the heart of liberty” with a viewpoint “formed under
compulsion of the State.” Casey, 505 U.S. at 851. At what is a deeply personal and sometimes
difficult moment in life, women and their family members will be faced with the fact that the State
will treat the tissue from their and their loved ones’ pregnancies as if it were a human being. This
will be an unwelcome and unacceptable intrusion into personal life for many people. Haffner Decl.
¶¶ 13-15, 17; Peterson Decl. ¶¶ 8-11. It will create stress, cause offense, and impose shame and
stigma on women as punishment for having miscarriage management, abortion, or ectopic
pregnancy surgery. Haffner Decl. ¶¶ 17-18; Peterson Decl. ¶¶ 12-15. Women who hold different
views from the State about the personhood of embryos, or the propriety of funeral practices, will
be compelled to acquiesce to the State’s view. Haffner Decl. ¶¶ 10-12, 19-20; Peterson Decl. ¶ 11.
Further, women and their family members who are opposed to burial or scattering ashes will
nevertheless be left with the macabre knowledge that the State is engaging in it anyway, and that
individuals or groups might seek to perform religious rituals or create ideological memorials, at
the location where burial or scattering ashes occurs, all without their consent. Haffner Decl. ¶¶ 1718; Peterson Decl. ¶¶ 13-14; Letter from ACLU of Texas to DSHS Re: Texas Public Information
Act Request (Oct. 13, 2016), and DSHS’ Response (Oct. 24, 2016) (attached hereto as App. I).
The Regulation effectively labels abortion, miscarriage, and ectopic pregnancy the death of a

13

Case 1:16-cv-01300-SS Document 6 Filed 12/12/16 Page 20 of 35

person, injecting the State’s viewpoint into a woman’s decision-making. Abortion and miscarriage
are already highly stigmatized, and the Regulation cannot help but increase that stigma. Haffner
Decl. ¶¶ 10-11, 17.
b. The Regulation Harms Women ’s Health and Safety.
The Regulation requires healthcare providers to ensure disposal of embryonic or fetal
tissue using a permitted method, even for tissue sent to a third-party such as a pathology lab or
crime lab. See 25 Tex. Admin. Code § 1.136(a). Importantly, this means that, should a pathology
or crime lab to which Plaintiffs send tissue for analysis not dispose of it by burial or scattering
ashes, Plaintiffs would be liable. Id.; 41 Tex. Reg. at 9717. Pathological testing of abnormal
pregnancy tissue is important for women’s health: it can screen for cancer, or the likelihood of
future abnormalities. Davis Decl. ¶ 31; Hagstrom Miller Decl. ¶ 19. Likewise, forensic
examination is important for evidentiary purposes in sex crimes, and Plaintiffs are required to
comply with law enforcement requests for tissue. Hagstrom Miller Decl. ¶ 20. This presents
Plaintiffs with a terrible dilemma: forego the testing necessary for their patients’ health and safety
(and face liability for malpractice or contempt) or risk liability under the Regulation.
c. The Regulation Threatens Access to Medical Care.
The Regulation makes the availability of abortion services contingent on the ability and
willingness of third-party vendors to bury or scatter the ashes of embryonic or fetal tissue at a
non-prohibitive cost. Every funeral home and crematorium surveyed by plaintiffs, save one,
quoted minimum prices of several hundred dollars—comparable to the cost of a first-trimester
abortion. Declaration of Anne Layne-Farrar, Ph.D. (“Layne-Farrar Decl.”) (attached hereto as
App. F) ¶¶ 23-29. These options are thus prohibitively expensive. Hagstrom Miller Decl. ¶¶ 22-

14

Case 1:16-cv-01300-SS Document 6 Filed 12/12/16 Page 21 of 35

23; Davis Decl. ¶¶ 24-25.8
Plaintiffs are aware of only one facility in the entire state willing and able to provide
cremation services at a feasible cost. Layne-Farrar Decl. ¶ 23; Hagstrom Miller Decl. ¶ 24.9 But
restricting abortion clinics to working with one vendor in the entire state is an unacceptable threat
to abortion access. As with the law struck down in Whole Woman’s Health, the Regulation here
ties the continued existence of abortion clinics to maintaining an ongoing relationship with thirdparty providers of a medically-unnecessary service, leaving the clinics susceptible to closure
should the vendors determine it is not in their business interests to associate with abortion
providers.10 Compare Whole Woman’s Health, 136 S. Ct. at 2312 (reviewing reasons hospitals
may be unwilling to provide admitting privileges), with Layne-Farrar Decl. ¶¶ 39-49 (reviewing
funeral homes’ concerns around ability to provide services). And here, there is only one available
provider, who may be unable to serve the entire state. Layne-Farrar Decl. ¶ 28; see also id. ¶ 64

8

DSHS states that “[b]ased upon the lowest stated costs of each entity able to provide cost
estimates, the department has determined that the annual cost per facility would be approximately
$450,” and further that “the cost of any of the new available methods would be offset by the
elimination of the cost of landfill disposition.” 41 Tex. Reg. at 9712. Beyond simply adopting the
lowest estimates as the expected costs, these statements do not state how DSHS arrived at the $450
figure. They are merely DSHS’ ipse dixit.
9

This option may nevertheless result in price increases for some Plaintiffs. In light of the
Regulation’s complete lack of benefits, supra at 11-15, infra at 15-16, any price increase is a
burden that outweighs the benefit, and so renders the Regulation unconstitutional under Whole
Woman’s Health.
10

DSHS states that “private parties have offered to bury fetal remains without charge.” 41 Tex.
Reg. at 7660. That statement is misleading, because when asked to identify these parties, DSHS
named only one, which did not offer services “without charge.” Letter from ACLU of Texas to
DSHS Re: Texas Public Information Act Request (Oct. 13, 2016), and DSHS’ Response (Oct. 24,
2016). But this party’s offer does indicate that it serves an explicitly religious and anti-abortion
purpose. Id. DSHS’ suggestion that abortion providers affiliate with such parties would thus force
women who chose abortion to have their tissue buried by groups working to oppose that choice,
see Planned Parenthood Minn., N.D., S.D. v. Daugaard, 799 F. Supp. 2d 1048, 1060 (D.S.D. 2011)
(requiring an abortion patient to meet with anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers “humiliates and
degrades her as a human being”).
15

Case 1:16-cv-01300-SS Document 6 Filed 12/12/16 Page 22 of 35

(single cemetery “can’t handle the entire state”). The survival of clinics throughout the state would
thus hang by a thin thread. Seen as unstable, clinics will find it hard to obtain loans, and employees
will become reluctant to join or stay. Hagstrom Miller Decl. ¶¶ 25-31; Davis Decl. ¶ 30; LayneFarrar Decl. ¶ 28. These effects make it harder both for clinics to provide care and to keep their
doors open—and help to ensure that clinic closures become permanent. See Planned Parenthood
of Greater Tex. Surgical Health Servs. v. Abbott, 134 S. Ct. 506, 509 (2013) (Breyer, J., dissenting
from denial of application to vacate stay) (“The longer a given facility remains closed, the less
likely it is ever to reopen even if the [challenged] requirement is ultimately held
unconstitutional.”). Thus far, only one clinic shuttered by HB 2, which was closed for but a few
months, has reopened. Further closures would be the predictable result of the Regulation.
Additionally, the Regulation would likely cause price increase in the cost of miscarriage
management and ectopic pregnancy treatment. In particular, doctors’ offices, which do not require
regular disposal of embryonic or fetal tissue, would need to incur the cost of arranging for special
disposition of such tissue on a case-by-case basis for miscarriage patients. See Layne-Farrar Decl.
¶¶ 31-33. Because health insurance does not cover funeral expenses, these extra costs would likely
be borne by patients, and would represent a serious, perhaps dissuasive burden, for patients who
are poor. See id. ¶¶ 35-37, 37 n.42, 47, 61-63; Davis Decl. ¶ 26.
5.

These Burdens Are Unconstitutional.

Once the Regulation’s numerous burdens are weighed against its failure to even minimally
further a permissible state interest, it becomes clear that the Regulation imposes an undue burden
on women’s liberty. It is an unprecedented and bizarre intrusion into the privacy and dignity of
women and their families, imposing funeral rituals and government ideology on people against
their will. It would stigmatize and shame women who seek abortion, miscarriage management, or
ectopic pregnancy treatment. It would threaten women’s health and safety. It is the next chapter
16

Case 1:16-cv-01300-SS Document 6 Filed 12/12/16 Page 23 of 35

in the Texas Government’s frustrated effort to end legal abortion in the state. And, it does not
further a legitimate state interest.
A law that restricts access to abortion and burdens treatment for pregnancy complications,
but does nothing to further a legitimate interest, is unjustified by even a minimal burden. Whole
Woman’s Health, 136 S. Ct. at 2318 (an abortion restriction is unconstitutional where it provides
“few, if any” benefits for women); Casey, 505 U.S. at 877; Carey v. Population Servs., Int’l, 431
U.S. 678, 687 (1977) (“[T]he Constitution protects individual decisions in matters of childbearing
from unjustified intrusion by the State.”); cf. Veasey, 830 F.3d at 239 (“We cannot say that the
district court had to simply accept that legislators were really so concerned with this almost
nonexistent problem.”). Moreover, the burden that the Regulation imposes—in the loss of liberty,
in stigma and shame, in risks to health and safety, in the threat of loss of access to healthcare
services—is substantial. Therefore, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that the
Regulation imposes unconstitutional burdens on the right to seek pregnancy-related medical care.
B. The Regulation Is Unconstitutionally Vague.
The Due Process Clause prohibits the deprivation of life, liberty, or property based on a
law “so vague that it fails to give ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes, or
standardless that it invites arbitrary enforcement.” Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551, 2556
(2015); accord Women’s Med. Ctr. of Nw. Houston v. Bell, 248 F.3d 411, 421-22 (5th Cir. 2001)
(holding that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that abortion regulations
were unconstitutionally vague); Austin Lifecare Inc. v. City of Austin, No. A-11-CA-875-LY, slip
op. at 10-13 (W.D. Tex. June 23, 2014) (ECF Doc. No. 145) (holding that municipal regulations
were unconstitutionally vague). “The degree of vagueness that the Constitution tolerates—as well
as the relative importance of fair notice and fair enforcement—depends in part on the nature of the
enactment.” Vill. of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 498 (1982).
17

Case 1:16-cv-01300-SS Document 6 Filed 12/12/16 Page 24 of 35

The Regulation requires application of a “stringent vagueness test” for three reasons. First,
“it threatens to inhibit the exercise of constitutionally protected rights” by burdening access to
abortion services. Id. at 499. The Supreme Court has long recognized this as “the most important
factor affecting the clarity that the Constitution demands of a law.” Id.; accord Colautti v. Franklin,
439 U.S. 379, 391, 394 (1979) (holding that an abortion regulation that conditioned potential
liability “on confusing and ambiguous criteria” was unconstitutionally vague because it
“present[ed] serious problems of notice, discriminatory application, and chilling effect on the
exercise of constitutional rights”). Second, it imposes quasi-criminal penalties on abortion
providers for non-compliance, through its incorporation by reference into the State’s licensing
standards for abortion facilities. 25 Tex. Admin. Code § 139.33 (listing penalties); id.
§ 139.53(a)(13) (incorporating the Regulation by reference). See also Bell, 248 F.3d at 422
(Texas’s licensing standards for abortion facilities “carry potentially significant civil and
administrative penalties, including fines and license revocation, which can be characterized as
quasi-criminal.”). Laws that impose criminal or quasi-criminal penalties are held to a higher
standard of clarity than other laws.11 See Vill. of Hoffman Estates, 455 U.S. at 499-500; Ford Motor
Co. v. Tex. Dep’t of Transp., 264 F.3d 493, 508 (5th Cir. 2001). Third, abortion providers are
especially vulnerable to arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the Regulation. See Bell, 248
F.3d at 422. “Although the [vagueness] doctrine focuses both on actual notice to citizens and
arbitrary enforcement, . . . the more important aspect of vagueness doctrine is . . . the requirement
that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.” Kolender v. Lawson,
461 U.S. 352, 357-58 (1983) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). In the absence of

11

Notably, the Regulation lacks a scienter requirement to mitigate the impact of its vagueness. See
supra at 14; see also Vill. of Hoffman Estates, 455 U.S. at 489; Colautti, 439 U.S. at 395.
18

Case 1:16-cv-01300-SS Document 6 Filed 12/12/16 Page 25 of 35

such guidelines, a law may enable enforcement officials “to pursue their personal predilections.”
Id. at 358 (internal quotation marks omitted). This risk is heightened “in the context of abortion, a
constitutionally protected right that has been a traditional target of hostility.” Bell, 248 F.3d at 422.
The Regulation cannot satisfy the stringent vagueness test required by the Due Process
Clause because it fails to provide healthcare providers and enforcement officials with clarity about
two critical issues: (1) whether the Regulation applies to fetal tissue resulting from abortions
performed at twenty weeks since a woman’s last menstrual period (“lmp”) or later; and (2) what,
if anything, must be done with the ashes resulting from the cremation of embryonic and fetal tissue.
As a result, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their vagueness claim.
First, the Regulation is unconstitutionally vague because it fails to provide clarity about
whether it applies to fetal tissue resulting from abortions performed at twenty weeks lmp or later.
DSHS’ received comments from groups such as the Texas Medical Association, the Texas
Hospital Association, and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists opposing
the Regulation for reasons including a concern that fetal death certificates would be required in
order to dispose of embryonic or fetal tissue, “for every miscarriage, abortion or ectopic pregnancy
in the state, leading to private medical histories becoming part of Texas public record.” 41 Tex.
Reg. at 9715. In response, DSHS states, “[a] fetal death certificate is only required for a fetus that
weighs 350 grams or is 20 weeks or more.12 If fetal death meets this threshold age or weight
requiring a death certificate, the fetal death is exempt from the [Regulation] pursuant to
§ 1.133(a)(2)(F).13 If no fetal death certificate is required, due to age or weight, there is no

12

This “requirement” refers to Texas’s fetal death certificate regulation, 25 Tex. Admin. Code
§ 181.7(a), see infra at 20.
13

25 Tex. Admin. Code § 1.133(a)(2)(F) exempts the “disposition of fetal remains . . . transferred
for disposition to a licensed funeral director” from compliance with the Regulation.
19

Case 1:16-cv-01300-SS Document 6 Filed 12/12/16 Page 26 of 35

requirement for a funeral director, who assumes custody of a fetus, to file a report[.]” 41 Tex. Reg.
at 9715 (emphasis added). DSHS thus seems to suggest that “age or weight,” but not the fact of a
stillbirth, determine whether fetal tissue is to be disposed of under the Regulation, or by means of
discharge to a funeral director, with the accompanying issuance of a fetal death certificate.
Texas’s fetal death certificate regulation is entitled, “Fetal Death (Stillbirth);” it applies to
“any fetus weighing 350 grams or more, or if the weight is unknown, a fetus aged 20 weeks or
more [lmp].” 25 Tex. Admin. Code § 181.7(a).14 The provision’s title makes plain that it is
intended to apply to stillbirths, not abortions. So does its purpose—to allow for the creation of
usable vital statistics data. See 41 Tex. Reg. at 9713.15 DSHS has never required a “certificate of
fetal death (stillbirth)” for any abortion. There is no clear reason for DSHS’ apparent position that
§ 1.133(a)(2)(F) limits the Regulation’s application to abortions under 350 grams and before 20
weeks lmp, and therefore requires issuance of a fetal death certificate, pursuant to 25 Tex. Admin.
Code § 181.7(a), for other abortions. To date, DSHS has not responded to requests for clarification.
Plaintiffs do not know whether they must dispose of this tissue as directed by the
Regulation, or whether they must obtain a “certificate of fetal death (stillbirth)” pursuant to 25
Tex. Admin. Code § 181.7(a) and send the tissue to a funeral home.16 Absent clarification, the
Regulation is unconstitutionally vague. Cf. Women’s Med. Ctr. of Nw. Houston, 248 F.3d at 42122; Austin Lifecare Inc., No. A-11-CA-875-LY, slip op. at 10-13.
Second, the Regulation is unconstitutionally vague because it fails to provide clarity about

14

Accord 25 Tex. Admin. Code § 181.7(b)(2) (“A certificate of fetal death (stillbirth) shall be filed
with the local registrar within five days after the date of fetal death (stillbirth).”).
15

Abortion data is subject to a different reporting system. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 245.011.

16

Expanding the scope of 25 Tex. Admin. Code § 181.7(a) to reach induced abortions would raise
grave constitutional concerns. See infra at 22-26.

Case 1:16-cv-01300-SS Document 6 Filed 12/12/16 Page 27 of 35

what, if anything, healthcare providers are required to do with the ashes resulting from the
cremation of embryonic and fetal tissue. The Regulation defines “interment” as “[t]he disposition
of pathological waste using the process of cremation, entombment, burial, or placement in a niche
or by using the process of cremation followed by placement of the ashes in a niche, grave, or
scattering of ashes as authorized by law, unless prohibited by this subchapter.” 25 Tex. Admin.
Code § 1.132(33) (emphasis added). Given that cremation followed by disposition of the ashes is
presented as an alternative to cremation in itself, the plain language of this provision indicates that
interment can be accomplished by cremation in itself, with healthcare providers having no further
disposal obligations. The preamble to the Regulation, however, casts doubt on whether the
Department interprets the Regulation in this manner. See 41 Tex. Reg. at 9715 (“Facilities will be
responsible for disposition of cremated remains in a manner not otherwise prohibited by law”).
Further, if “interment” includes an obligation to ensure disposition of ashes, the Regulation
fails to provide clarity about permissible methods. It indicates that ashes may be scattered “as
authorized by law,” 25 Tex. Admin. Code § 1.132(33), but the only Texas law regulating the
scattering of ashes is Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 716.302-716.304, and the Regulation
expressly states that these provisions do not apply to the disposition of fetal tissue, see 25 Tex.
Admin. Code § 1.134(a) (“This subchapter does not extend or modify requirements of Texas
Health and Safety Code, Chapters 711 and 716 . . . to disposition of fetal tissue.”). See also
Hagstrom Miller Decl. ¶ 12. Moreover, the preamble to the Regulation states that: “The adopted
rules prohibit the disposition of fetal tissue in a sanitary landfill, and the language added to
paragraph (33) on adoption is subject to that limitation, prohibiting the scattering of ashes in a
landfill.” 41 Tex. Reg. at 9710. But the Regulation states no such prohibition. The Regulation
provides neither any “authorized” nor any “prohibited” locations or methods for scattering ashes.

21

Case 1:16-cv-01300-SS Document 6 Filed 12/12/16 Page 28 of 35

Thus, healthcare providers are left to guess at whether and how they must dispose of ashes. See
Hagstrom Miller Decl. ¶¶ 12-13; Davis Decl. ¶¶ 10, 33. The lack of clarity around this issue
renders the Regulation unconstitutional. Cf. Women’s Med. Ctr. of Nw. Houston, 248 F.3d at 42122; Austin Lifecare Inc., No. A-11-CA-875-LY, slip op. at 10-13.
C. Requiring Death Certificates for Abortions Violates Women’s Right to Privacy.
As discussed supra at 19-20, DSHS appears to be taking the position that 25 Tex. Admin.
Code § 181.7, and not the Regulation, governs the disposal of fetal tissue from abortions at and
after twenty weeks lmp. Plaintiffs are likely to prevail on their claim that application of § 181.7 to
abortions is unconstitutional.
Abortion in Texas is legal until twenty weeks post-fertilization. Tex. Health & Safety Code
§ 171.044. This is equivalent to twenty-two weeks lmp. See Davis Decl. ¶ 15 n.1. In cases of
certain medical emergencies and severe fetal anomalies, it is also permitted after that point of
pregnancy. See Tex. Health & Safety Code § 171.046. Thus, DSHS would apply the fetal death
certificate requirement to several hundred women obtaining abortion care in Texas each year.17
A “certificate of fetal death (stillbirth)” is a public record. As with all death certificates,
DSHS will provide one right away to the deceased’s “immediate family,” which would seem to
include the woman’s husband or partner, and possibly also other family members. See Tex. Health
& Safety Code § 191.051; 25 Tex. Admin. Code § 181.1(21). After twenty-five years, it becomes
available to the general public. Tex. Gov’t Code. § 552.115(a)(2).18

17

The Centers for Disease Control’s most recent statistics, from 2013, record 313 abortions in
Texas at or after 21 weeks lmp, and 481 from 18 through 20 weeks lmp. Tara C. Jatlaoui, et al.,

2016), available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/ss/ss6512a1.htm.
18

In addition, Summary Death Indexes stating surnames and counties, 25 Tex. Admin. Code
§ 181.23(c)(3), will also be publicly available, Tex. Gov’t Code § 552.115(a)(4).
22

A “certificate of fetal death (stillbirth)” contains a wealth of personally-identifying
information, including “the cause of fetal death” (which, here, would seemingly be abortion), the
“mother’s current legal name,” the “mother’s maiden surname,” and the “mother’s residence,”
among many other things. DSHS, Handbook on Fetal Death Registration, Ch. 2: Completing the

Plaintiffs’ Patients Have a Reasonable Expectation of Privacy.

The right to privacy protects an individual’s interest in avoiding “disclosure of personal
matters.” Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 599 (1977). The Fifth Circuit applies a balancing test,
upholding “[a]n intrusion into the interest in avoiding disclosure of personal information . . .
only . . . when the government demonstrates a legitimate state interest which is found to outweigh
the threat to the plaintiff's privacy interest.” ACLU of Miss., Inc. v. Mississippi, 911 F.2d 1066,
1070 (5th Cir. 1990) (quoting Fadjo v. Coon, 633 F.2d 1172, 1176 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981)). “[T]he
privacy interest in confidentiality [is] extensive.” Id.
Plaintiffs’ patients have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information that will be
disclosed. See, e.g., Cantu v. Rocha, 77 F.3d 795, 806 (5th Cir. 1996) (first step of analysis is
whether “the person had a legitimate expectation of privacy”). Plaintiffs’ patients reasonably
expect that their reproductive health care history, including their identity as a patient who has
obtained an abortion, should remain confidential. See, e.g., Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532
U.S. 67, 78 (2001) (individual has reasonable expectation of privacy in medical test results);
Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U.S. 622, 647-48 (1979) (requiring protection of minors’ confidentiality in
abortion proceedings); Tucson Woman’s Clinic v. Eden, 379 F.3d 531, 552 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding
that requirement to provide State with unredacted medical records of abortion patients that
included “patient identifying information such as names and full medical histories” violated
23

Case 1:16-cv-01300-SS Document 6 Filed 12/12/16 Page 30 of 35

patients’ right to informational privacy); ACLU of Miss., 911 F.2d at 1070 (holding that plaintiffs
“undeniably have an interest in restricting the disclosure” of matters related to their sexual lives).
Also, Texas law already recognizes that the identity of abortion patients should remain
confidential, prohibiting abortion providers from including any patient-identifying information in
their required annual reports to DSHS. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 245.011(b) (“The report may
not identify by any means the physician performing the abortion or the patient.”). Indeed, until
DSHS published the Regulation, there was never any question that 25 Tex. Admin. Code § 181.7
did not apply to abortions, and therefore the State never required healthcare providers to provide
the State with personally-identifying information about their abortion patients.
2.

The Exposure of Plaintiffs’ Patients’ Reproductive Health Histories to
the General Public Violates the Right to Privacy.

DSHS’ application of 25 Tex. Admin. Code § 181.7 would violate Plaintiffs’ patients’
privacy rights by leading to the disclosure to the general public of the identities of women who
have obtained abortions after twenty weeks lmp. See ACLU of Miss., 911 F.2d at 1070 (“Privacy
rights are directed . . . to the publication of true statements about persons where those true
statements . . . contain private facts that the government should not divulge.”). Requiring fetal
death certificates regarding abortions would publicize Plaintiffs’ patients’ names, ages,
birthplaces, addresses, marital statuses, and the facts of their abortions, without their consent—at
first to husbands or partners, and possibly others, and eventually to anyone who asks.
There is no legitimate reason for this disclosure, and certainly not one that outweighs the
harms imposed on Plaintiffs’ patients. In ACLU of Mississippi, the Fifth Circuit held that the public
disclosure of unredacted records from a state anti-civil rights spying unit did not “give sufficient
weight to the interest in accommodating privacy concerns,” 911 F.2d at 1075, because the records
would contain allegations about the sexual history of certain named individuals, id. at 1070. While
24

Case 1:16-cv-01300-SS Document 6 Filed 12/12/16 Page 31 of 35

the court found that there was a legitimate interest in disclosing the unit’s activities, the court also
found that “the disclosure of a particular name would rarely, if ever, be necessary to enumerate
and demonstrate the Commission’s divers dealings; the actual names of the Commission’s victims
are much less a matter for public concern.” Id. at 1071.
Here, the identities of women who have obtained abortions are not a matter of public
concern and are supposedly protected under Texas law, supra at 24, so there is no justification for
disclosing this information to the general public. There is simply no legitimate reason for putting
a confidential piece of a woman’s reproductive health history into the public record.
Courts have upheld laws requiring the disclosure of personal medical information to the
State only when there were significant safeguards in place to ensure that it would not be further
disclosed. E.g., Whalen, 429 U.S. at 599; Greenville Women’s Clinic v. Comm’r, S.C. Dep’t of
Health & Envtl. Control, 317 F.3d 357, 371 (4th Cir. 2002); contra Tucson, 379 F.3d at 552
(striking down a requirement to provide unredacted medical records to state inspectors in the
absence of penalties for unauthorized disclosure).
Moreover, publicly disclosing this information threatens women with additional harms
beyond the violation of privacy rights. The “potential for harm” in the “non-consensual disclosure
[of a woman’s abortion] is tremendous.” Tucson, 379 F.3d at 553; see also Casey, 505 U.S. at 893
(“[T]here are millions of women in this country who are the victims of regular physical and
psychological abuse at the hands of their husbands. . . . [T]hey may have very good reasons for
not wishing to inform their husbands of their decision to obtain an abortion.”). The State cannot
provide any legitimate justification for exposing women to such risks.
DSHS’ requirement fails the Fifth Circuit’s balancing test: It serves no legitimate state
interest, yet it will disclose to the general public highly confidential information about the

25

Case 1:16-cv-01300-SS Document 6 Filed 12/12/16 Page 32 of 35

reproductive health history of hundreds of Texas women.
II.

ALL OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
ARE SATISFIED.
Plaintiffs have demonstrated that, absent an injunction, they and their patients will suffer

irreparable injury. It is well established that, where a Plaintiff establishes a constitutional
violation, no further showing of irreparable injury is necessary. See Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S.
347, 373 (1976) (The loss of constitutional “freedoms . . . unquestionably constitutes irreparable
injury.”); Opulent Life Church v. City of Holly Springs, 697 F.3d 279, 295 (5th Cir. 2012)
(“When an alleged deprivation of a constitutional right is involved, most courts hold that no
further showing of irreparable injury is necessary.” (citation omitted)); Deerfield Med. Ctr. v.
City of Deerfield Beach, 661 F.2d 328, 338 (5th Cir. Unit B Nov. 1981) (When “the constitutional
right of privacy is ‘either threatened or in fact being impaired,’ . . . this conclusion mandates a
finding of irreparable injury.” (quoting Elrod, 427 U.S. at 373)). Therefore, Plaintiffs have
adequately demonstrated a substantial threat of irreparable injury.
But additionally, beyond the impact on their rights, the effect of the Regulation and
DSHS’ interpretation of it on Plaintiffs’ patients will be devastating and irreparable. The
Regulation mandates funeral rituals following pregnancy loss, threatens women’s health and
safety by providing no safe harbor for sending tissue to pathology or crime labs, and threatens
abortion clinics’ ability to provide care and keep their doors open. DSHS would identify to the
public every woman who has an abortion in Texas after twenty weeks lmp.
In contrast, Defendants face no injury from an injunction. It will merely preserve the
status quo while questions about the Regulation’s constitutionality are adjudicated, and the
public health will continue to be protected under existing law, as it has been for decades.
Moreover, the public interest will be served, rather than harmed, by injunctive relief. “[I]t
26

Case 1:16-cv-01300-SS Document 6 Filed 12/12/16 Page 33 of 35

is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a party’s constitutional rights.” Jackson
Women’s Health Org., 760 F.3d at 458 n.9 (alteration in original) (quoting Awad v. Ziriax, 670
F.3d 1111, 1132 (10th Cir. 2012)). Without a preliminary injunction, all women in Texas who
seek care for miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, and abortion will suffer unnecessary and
unjustified burdens to their constitutional rights.
Finally, this court may issue the requested preliminary injunction without requiring
Plaintiffs to provide security. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c); Corrigan Dispatch Co. v. Casa Guzman,
S. A., 569 F.2d 300, 303 (5th Cir. 1978) (“The amount of security required is a matter for the
discretion of the trial court; it may elect to require no security at all.”). Here, Defendants will
suffer no “costs [or] damages,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c), should the court later rescind the temporary
restraining order or preliminary injunction, and therefore no security should be required. See
Texans for Free Enter. v. Tex. Ethics Comm’n, No. A-12-CA-0845-LY, 2012 WL 12874899, at
*7 (W.D. Tex. Dec. 6, 2012), aff'd, 732 F.3d 535 (5th Cir. 2013).
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully ask this Court to enter a temporary restraining order
or, in the alternative, a preliminary injunction, without bond, restraining Defendant John
Hellerstedt, M.D., as well as his employees, agents, and successors in office, from enforcing the
Regulation, and from applying 25 Tex. Admin. Code § 181.7 to abortions, and enter such other
and further relief as the Court deems just, proper, and equitable.
