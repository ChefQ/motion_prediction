RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR
PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
COME NOW, Defendants, Phil Bryant, Governor of Mississippi, Jim Hood, Attorney
General of Mississippi, Richard Berry, Executive Director of the Mississippi Department of Human
Services, and Judy Moulder, Mississippi State Registrar of Vital Records, and submit this their
Response in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction as follows:
1.

Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction argues that H.B. 1523 violates the

Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment and seeks an immediate preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of H.B.
1523.
2.

To justify the extraordinary relief of a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs must show:

(1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) substantial threat of an irreparable injury
1

without the relief; (3) threatened injury that outweighs the potential harm to the party enjoined; and
(4) that granting the preliminary relief will not disserve the public interest. Tex. Med. Providers
Performing Abortion Servs. V. Lakey, 667 F.3d 570 574 (5th Cir. 2012). A movant must “clearly
establish each of the traditional four preliminary injunction elements.” DSC Commc’n. Corp. v.
DGI Techn., Inc., 81 F.3d 597, 600 (5th Cir. 1996).
3.

As a threshold matter, Plaintiffs’ cannot demonstrate a “substantial likelihood of

success on the merits” as they do not have standing to bring either their Establishment Clause or
Equal Protection Clause claims. Plaintiffs cannot show that they have suffered the requisite injury
for standing purposes and even if they could, their “injuries” are not “fairly traceable” to these
Defendants and would not be redressed by enjoining them.1
4.

Even if Plaintiffs could establish standing to bring their claims, they still cannot show

that H.B. 1523 is facially unconstitutional. H.B. 1523 does not bar Plaintiffs from getting married,
exercising any right associated with marriage, or holding or living by whatever moral or religious
beliefs they see fit.2 By its terms, H.B. 1523 is an accommodation law intended to convey the
strongest protection for the “free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions” permitted by
the state and federal constitutions. H.B. 1523 is about the people of conscience who need the

1

Recognizing the hypothetical nature of their injury claims, Plaintiffs resort to a “fallback” position alleging that the mere existence of this law “stigmatizes” thereby giving rise to
their equal protection challenge. However, the Supreme Court long ago rejected this type of
generalized stigmatic injury. Instead, the Court said “[t]he stigmatic injury thus requires
identification of some concrete interest with respect to which [plaintiffs] are personally subject
to discriminatory treatment. That interest must independently satisfy the causation requirement
of standing doctrine.” Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 795 n.22 (1984) (emphasis supplied).
2

H.B. 1523 expressly provides that in the event of a recusal by a clerk, the issuance of the
marriage license shall not be impeded or delayed thereby preventing the very kind of
discrimination that Plaintiffs claim will result from the law.
2

protection of H.B. 1523. Protection of free conscience and the Free Exercise of religion are not only
legitimate governmental interests, they are compelling governmental interests. H.B. 1523 is
constitutional as a reasonable accommodation for the protection of people holding moral and
religious beliefs – even though Plaintiffs find those beliefs offensive or repugnant.
5.

Even if Plaintiffs’ could some how demonstrate a “substantial likelihood of success

on the merits”, as stated above their alleged injuries are hypothetical in nature and prevent Plaintiffs
from demonstrating the type of imminent harm that is the hallmark of the extraordinary remedy of
a preliminary injunction.
6.

Defendants further relies on the Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for

Preliminary Injunction being filed simultaneously herewith.
WHEREFORE, Defendants respectfully request that the Court deny Plaintiffs’ Motion for
Preliminary Injunction.
This the 17th day of June, 2016.
