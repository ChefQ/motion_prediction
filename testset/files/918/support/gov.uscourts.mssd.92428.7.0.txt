MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT
OF MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
INTRODUCTION
This lawsuit is a federal constitutional challenge to House Bill 1523 of the 2016
Session of the Mississippi Legislature. With the passage and approval of that bill, the
Legislature and the Governor breached the separation of church and state, and
specifically endorsed and provided special protections for specific religious beliefs and
moral convictions that (1) condemn same-sex couples who get married, (2) condemn
unmarried people who have sexual relations, and (3) condemn transgender people. H.B.
1523 was clearly enacted for religious purposes. Specifically, the bill was enacted to

Case 3:16-cv-00417-CWR-LRA Document 7 Filed 06/03/16 Page 2 of 18

promote, endorse, and provide special protection for these particular beliefs and
convictions. H.B. 1523 also targets for disfavor and unequal treatment, and is the result
of animus towards, the particular individuals and groups who are condemned by these
beliefs and convictions. There is no rational basis for the discriminatory treatment of
those who are disfavored by the State through H.B. 1523, and no rational basis for
exclusively endorsing and providing special protections for those people who subscribe
to these beliefs and convictions.

Accordingly, H.B. 1523 violates the First and

Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.
The individual plaintiffs in this case are citizens, residents, and taxpayers of the
State of Mississippi. The plaintiffs include ministers, community leaders, civic activists,
and a Hattiesburg church. They also include a married lesbian couple, a gay man who
plans to marry his male partner this summer, an unmarried woman who is involved in a
long-term romantic relationship with an unmarried man that includes sexual relations, a
transgender woman, and a transgender man. The plaintiffs – who have read the text of
H.B. 1523 and followed the extensive media coverage of this controversial bill – disagree
with the beliefs and convictions endorsed by the State through H.B. 1523 and are deeply
offended by the State’s endorsement and special protection of them. The endorsement
and special protection of these beliefs and convictions conveys a state-sponsored message
of disapproval and hostility to those people who do not share these beliefs, including the
plaintiffs and many other Mississippians, and indicates that their status is disfavored in
the social and political community of their own home state. The endorsement and special
protection of these beliefs and convictions sends an especially hostile message to those
2

Case 3:16-cv-00417-CWR-LRA Document 7 Filed 06/03/16 Page 3 of 18

plaintiffs and other Mississippians whose relationships and identities are condemned by
these beliefs and convictions.
Unless it is enjoined by this Court, the State’s endorsement and special protection
of these beliefs and convictions through H.B. 1523 will become the law of the plaintiffs’
home state on July 1, 2016.

Thus, the harms faced by the plaintiffs and other

Mississippians who do not share these beliefs and convictions is imminent.
BACKGROUND
House Bill 1523
The text of Section 2 of H.B. 1523 provides as follows:
The sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions protected by this
act are the belief or conviction that:
(a) Marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and
one woman;
(b) Sexual relations are properly reserved to such a marriage; and
(c) Male (man) or female (woman) refer to an individual’s
immutable biological sex as objectively determined by anatomy
and genetics at time of birth.
H.B. 1523, 2016 Leg. Reg. Sess., §2 (Miss. 2016).
H.B. 1523 provides a number of special protections exclusively for people and
religious organizations who subscribe to the religious beliefs and moral convictions set
forth in Section 2. These protections include immunity from certain actions by the state
government. Without listing all of them, here are some examples:

3

Case 3:16-cv-00417-CWR-LRA Document 7 Filed 06/03/16 Page 4 of 18

Section 3(3) of the bill purports to prohibit the state government from taking
action against a person who has been granted custody of a foster or adoptive child and
who instructs or raises that child “consistent with a sincerely held religious belief or
moral conviction described in Section 2 of this Act.” Presumably, this would mean that
even if something about the particular circumstances of the raising of a particular foster
or adoptive child in a particular home “consistent with” the beliefs and convictions
endorsed by Section 2 was so harmful that action otherwise would be taken to remove the
child, the state government would be prohibited from doing so.
Section 3(4) of the bill purports to prohibit (among other things) the state
government from taking action against a person for declining to provide psychological or
counseling services “based upon a sincerely held religious belief or moral conviction
described in Section 2 of this act,” and presumably would preclude the state government
from requiring a psychologist or counselor paid with public funds to provide services to a
transgender youth if the psychologist or counselor refuses to do so based upon the beliefs
and convictions endorsed in Section 2(c) of the bill.
Section 3(6) of the bill purports to prohibit the state government from taking
action against a person who “establishes sex-specific standards or policies concerning
employees or student dress or grooming” based upon the beliefs and convictions
endorsed in Section 2(c) of the bill.
Section 3(7) purports to give state employees special protection regarding their
speech so long as that speech is “consistent with a sincerely held religious belief or moral
conviction described in Section 2 of this act.”
4

Case 3:16-cv-00417-CWR-LRA Document 7 Filed 06/03/16 Page 5 of 18

Section 3(8)(a) allows individual clerks, registers of deeds, and their deputies, all
of whom are government employees, to refuse to issue marriage licenses to couples if
they do so “based upon or in a manner consistent with a sincerely held religious belief or
moral conviction described in Section 2 of this act” and if they take all necessary steps to
ensure that the licensing of any legally valid marriage is not impeded or delayed by their
recusal. Section 3(8)(b) allows individual judges – even those who otherwise perform
weddings for anyone who has a license – to refuse to perform weddings of couples
“based upon or in a manner consistent with a sincerely held religious belief or moral
conviction described in Section 2 of this act.” This section allows clerks and judges who
hold either of the first two religious beliefs or moral convictions endorsed in Section 2 of
the bill to refrain from facilitating marriages between same-sex couples and couples who
have engaged in sexual relations before being married. The statute may also extend to
people who are divorced and wish to subsequently marry other people: a clerk or judge’s
strongly held religious belief or moral conviction that a marriage is “between one man
and one woman” may regard any marriage as eternal, regardless of civil laws, making
subsequent marriages bigamous.
Section 4(a)-(e) limits the State’s ability to make decisions about taxes, benefits,
and fines with respect to those people and religious organizations who subscribe to the
beliefs and convictions endorsed in Section 2 and engage in the actions described in
Section 3 of the bill.
Section 5 purports to give people who subscribe to the beliefs and convictions
endorsed in Section 2 the right to raise those beliefs and convictions as a claim in the
5

Case 3:16-cv-00417-CWR-LRA Document 7 Filed 06/03/16 Page 6 of 18

courts for violations of the provisions of the bill, and to raise violations of the bill as a
defense in any judicial or administrative proceeding.
Section 8(3) of the bill purports to prevent any agency or subdivision of the state
government, presumably including any county or municipality, from adopting an
ordinance, regulation, or policy that would be contrary to the provisions of the bill.
Presumably, this means that a municipality which adopted an ordinance prohibiting
businesses from discriminating against people based upon their sexual orientation would
nevertheless be unable to enforce that ordinance against businesses that declined to
provide marriage-related accommodations, facilities, goods, and services to same-sex
couples based upon the religious beliefs and moral convictions endorsed in Section 2 of
the bill.
To reiterate, the examples just listed are not an exhaustive catalogue of the
provisions of House Bill 1523 or the special protections that it provides to the religious
beliefs and moral convictions endorsed in Section 2 of the bill.
The Plaintiffs
The plaintiffs to this lawsuit are: (1) The Rev. Dr. Rims Barber, the director of the
Mississippi Human Services Coalition and an ordained Presbyterian minister; (2) The
Rev. Carol Burnett, an ordained Methodist minister; (3) Joan Bailey, a retired therapist
with a practice largely devoted to lesbian women; (4) Katherine Elizabeth Day, a
transgender woman who is an artist and activist; (5) Anthony (“Tony”) Laine Boyette, a
transgender man; (6) Rev. Don Fortenberry, an ordained Methodist minister and the
retired Chaplain of Millsaps College; (7) Dr. Susan Glisson, the Senior Fellow on
6

Case 3:16-cv-00417-CWR-LRA Document 7 Filed 06/03/16 Page 7 of 18

Reconciliation and Founding Director of the William Winter Institute for Racial
Reconciliation at the University of Mississippi, who is an unmarried woman in a longterm romantic relationship with an unmarried man that involves sexual relations; (8)
Derrick Johnson, the Executive Director of the Mississippi State Conference of the
NAACP; (9) Dorothy C. Triplett, a retired state and municipal government employee and
a longtime community and political activist; (10) Renick Taylor, a political activist and a
Field Engineer at CBIZ Network Solutions, who is a gay man engaged to be married to
his male partner during the summer of 2016; (11) Brandiilyne Mangum-Dear, the Pastor
at the Joshua Generation Metropolitan Community Church, who is a lesbian woman and
has been married to her partner, Susan Mangum, since 2015; (12) Susan Mangum, the
Director of Worship at the Joshua Generation Metropolitan Community Church, who is a
lesbian woman and has been married to her partner, Brandiilyne Mangum-Dear, since
2015; and, (13) the Joshua Generation Metropolitan Community Church, an inclusive
ministry that welcomes all people regardless of age, race, sexual orientation, gender
identity, or social status and includes a number of members who are within the three
groups that are targeted by Section 2 of H.B. 1523 – same-sex couples who are married
or intend to marry, unmarried people engaged in relationships that include sexual
relations, and transgender people. Each of the individual plaintiffs is a citizen, resident,
and taxpayer of the State of Mississippi.
Because of the public enactment by the Legislature and the Governor of H.B.
1523, including its endorsement of the religious beliefs and moral convictions set forth in
H.B. 1523, each of the plaintiffs has been confronted with that endorsement. Each of the
7

Case 3:16-cv-00417-CWR-LRA Document 7 Filed 06/03/16 Page 8 of 18

plaintiffs has read and become familiar with the text of H.B. 1523. Each has been
exposed to the intense controversy surrounding the bill and has followed much of the
extensive media coverage. Each is aware that, unless enjoined, H.B. 1523 will become
the law of their home state of Mississippi on July 1, 2016.
The plaintiffs do not subscribe to any of the religious beliefs and moral
convictions that are endorsed in Section 2 of H.B. 1523 and that are given special
protection by H.B. 1523. The plaintiffs disagree with those beliefs and convictions and
are offended by the State’s endorsement and special protection of them.

The

endorsement and special protection of those beliefs and convictions conveys a statesponsored message of disapproval and hostility to those who do not share those beliefs
and convictions, including the plaintiffs and many other Mississippians, and indicates
that their status is disfavored in the social and political community of their own home
state. At the same time, the endorsement and special protection of those beliefs and
convictions sends a message to Mississippians who do share those beliefs and convictions
that they are favored members of the social and political community.
As mentioned previously, Plaintiff Renick Taylor is a gay man who is engaged to
be married to his male partner, and Plaintiff Brandiilyne Mangum-Dear and Plaintiff
Susan Mangum are a married lesbian couple. Their relationships and marriages are
contrary to the State’s endorsement in H.B. 1523 of the belief and conviction that
“Marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman.” H.B.
1523, 2016 Leg. Reg. Sess., §2(a) (Miss. 2016). That endorsement and the special
protection of that belief and conviction sends a state-sponsored message of disapproval
8

Case 3:16-cv-00417-CWR-LRA Document 7 Filed 06/03/16 Page 9 of 18

and hostility to these particular plaintiffs and to other gay and lesbian citizens of
Mississippi, indicating that they are disfavored in the social and political community of
their own home state.
As mentioned previously, Plaintiff Dr. Susan Glisson is an unmarried woman in a
long-term romantic relationship with an unmarried man that includes sexual relations.
This is contrary to the State’s endorsement in H.B. 1523 of the belief and conviction that
“Sexual relations are properly reserved to … a marriage [between one man and one
woman].” H.B. 1523, 2016 Leg. Reg. Sess., §2(b) (Miss. 2016). That endorsement and
the special protection of that belief and conviction sends a state-sponsored message of
disapproval and hostility to Dr. Susan Glisson and other unmarried adult citizens of
Mississippi who are involved in sexual relationships, indicating that they are disfavored
in the social and political community of their own home state.
As mentioned previously, Plaintiff Katherine Elizabeth Day is a transgender
woman and Plaintiff Tony Boyette is a transgender man. This is contrary to the State’s
endorsement in H.B. 1523 of the belief and conviction that “Male (man) or female
(woman) refer to an individual’s immutable biological sex as objectively determined by
anatomy and genetics at the time of birth.” H.B. 1523, 2016 Leg. Reg. Sess., §2(c)
(Miss. 2016). That endorsement and the special protection of that belief and conviction
sends a state-sponsored message of disapproval and hostility to Katherine Elizabeth Day,
Tony Boyette, and other transgender citizens of Mississippi, indicating that they are
disfavored in the social and political community of their own home state.

ARGUMENT
“The four elements a plaintiff must establish to secure a preliminary injunction
are:
(1) Substantial likelihood of success on the merits, (2) a substantial threat
of irreparable injury if the injunction is not issued; (3) that the threatened
injury if the injunction is denied outweighs any harm that will result if the
injunction is granted, and (4) that the grant of an injunction will not
disserve the public interest.”
Janvey v. Alguire, 647 F.3d 585, 595 (5th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). In this case, the
plaintiffs have established each element.
I.

THE PLAINTIFFS ARE LIKELY TO PREVAIL ON THE MERITS.
Clearly, the plaintiffs have standing.

Among other things, they are citizens,

residents, and taxpayers in Mississippi who do not subscribe to the religious beliefs and
moral convictions that are endorsed in House Bill 1523, and who are offended by the
State’s endorsement and special protection of those beliefs and convictions. In at least
two of the crèche-menorah cases, the plaintiffs were described by the United States
Supreme Court simply as “residents” of the county and the city in which the religious
symbols were displayed. County of Allegheny v. ACLU, 492 U.S. 573, 587-88 (1989);
Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 671 (1984). In Croft v. Governor of Texas, 562 F.3d
735 (5th Cir. 2009), the Fifth Circuit addressed standing in an Establishment Clause
challenge to a moment of silence:
The Crofts have alleged that their children are enrolled in Texas public
schools and are required to observe the moment of silence daily. . . . The
Crofts’ children are definitely present for the moment of silence, and . . . we
can assume that they or their parents have been offended—else they would
10

Case 3:16-cv-00417-CWR-LRA Document 7 Filed 06/03/16 Page 11 of 18

not be challenging the law. That is enough to establish standing at this
[summary judgment] stage of the suit.
Id. at 746.
The fact that the plaintiffs here are challenging a religious endorsement expressed
through a statute rather than through a symbolic, physical object like a crèche, an oral
event like a prayer, or a moment of silence, does not matter for purposes of standing. In
Awad v. Ziriax, 670 F.3d 1111 (10th Cir. 2012), the Tenth Circuit held that a Muslim
plaintiff had standing to challenge an Oklahoma referendum to amend the state
constitution to prohibit state courts from considering or using international law or Shariah
law. In so doing, the Court noted that the “personal and unwelcome contact” the plaintiff
had with the constitutional amendment was no different for standing purposes than the
“personal and unwelcome contact” other plaintiffs had with government sponsored
religious symbols. Id. at 1122.
In some respects, Mr. Awad's alleged injuries are similar to those found
sufficient to confer standing in our religious symbol Establishment Clause
cases. Like the plaintiffs who challenged the highway crosses in American
Atheists [v. Davenport, 637 F.3d 1095 (10th Cir. 2010)], Mr. Awad suffers a
form of ‘personal and unwelcome contact’ with an amendment to the
Oklahoma Constitution that would target his religion for disfavored
treatment. As a Muslim and citizen of Oklahoma, Mr. Awad is ‘directly
affected by the law [ ] ... against which [his] complaints are directed.’ See
Valley Forge [Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of
Church and State], 454 U.S. [464] at 487 n. 22 [(1982)] (quoting, Abington
Sch. Dist. v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 224 n. 9 (1963)). As further spelled
out below, that is enough to confer standing. See Schempp, 374 U.S. at 224
n. 9.
Awad, 670 F.3d at 1122. In discussing further the plaintiff’s standing in the case, the
Tenth Circuit also noted that “Mr. Awad is facing the consequences of a statewide

11

Case 3:16-cv-00417-CWR-LRA Document 7 Filed 06/03/16 Page 12 of 18

election approving a constitutional measure that would disfavor his religion relative to
others.” Id. at 1123.
Like the plaintiffs in Croft enduring a moment of silence to which they were
subjected, the plaintiffs here are required to endure an endorsement of religion in the law
of their own state to which they object. And like the plaintiff in Awad, the plaintiffs here
are “facing the consequences” of a statutory enactment “that would disfavor [their
beliefs] relative to others.” Awad, 670 F.3d at 1122. Just as standing was established in
those cases, so it is here.1
In addition to the standing of the plaintiffs as people whose beliefs are disfavored
because they do not subscribe to the state-endorsed beliefs and convictions set forth in
H.B. 1523, Plaintiffs Taylor, Mangum-Dear, Mangum, Glisson, Day, and Boyette are
among the groups who are targeted by the State’s endorsement of the beliefs and
convictions condemning same-sex couples who are married or plan to marry (Taylor,
Mangum-Dear, and Mangum), who are unmarried and in relationships that include sexual
relations (Glisson), and who are transgender (Day and Boyette). Moreover, Plaintiff
Glisson has standing as a state employee who is not accorded the purported speech rights
provided by Section 3(7) of the bill to those who subscribe to the beliefs and convictions
endorsed by H.B. 1523.
There is a substantial likelihood that the plaintiffs will prevail on the merits. By
setting forth in Section 2 three specific religious beliefs for which certain exclusive

1

As just set forth, injury exists. Moreover, the injury clearly was caused by enactment of H.B. 1523, and
the injury will be redressed if the statute is enjoined.

12

Case 3:16-cv-00417-CWR-LRA Document 7 Filed 06/03/16 Page 13 of 18

protections are provided, H.B. 1523 clearly “conveys a message of endorsement” of those
beliefs. Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 57 n. 42 (1975) (quoting Lynch v. Donnelly, 465
U.S. at 690 (O’Connor, J., concurring)). Moreover, the purpose of the bill is clearly to
endorse and promote those specific religious beliefs.

Thus, the bill violates the

Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Wallace, 472 U.S. at 57; Lemon v.
Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 612-13 (1971).
In Awad v. Ziriax, 670 F.3d at 1126-1129, the Tenth Circuit affirmed the grant of a
preliminary injunction and noted that the plaintiff was likely to prevail on the merits in
his Establishment Clause challenge to the Oklahoma constitutional referendum to
prohibit state courts from considering international law or Shariah law. The Tenth
Circuit examined the merits under the analysis employed by the Supreme Court for
“explicit and deliberate distinctions between different religious organizations.” Larson v.
Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 247 n. 23 (1982). Such a law is constitutional only if it is “closely
fitted to the furtherance of any compelling interested asserted.” Id. at 255. The Tenth
Circuit held that the proposed Oklahoma constitutional amendment was not justified by
any compelling state interest (and also that all of the other preliminary injunction factors
favored the plaintiff). 670 F.3d at 1129-1132.
While the present case does not involve what Larson calls an “explicit and
deliberate distinction[] between different religious organizations,” it does involve an
explicit and deliberate distinction between different religious beliefs. There certainly is
no compelling interest, or indeed any legitimate interest, that justifies this distinction. At
any rate, whether the analysis in this case is more appropriate under Larson or under
13

Case 3:16-cv-00417-CWR-LRA Document 7 Filed 06/03/16 Page 14 of 18

Lemon and subsequent cases, the result is the same: H.B. 1523 violates the Establishment
Clause.
Beyond the First Amendment violation, H.B. 1523 also violates the Fourteenth
Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. The bill specifically targets and disfavors those
who do not subscribe to the beliefs and convictions endorsed in Section 2 of the bill.
Further, by endorsing those beliefs and convictions, the bill targets and disfavors samesex couples who are married or plan to marry, people who are unmarried and in
relationships that include sexual relations, and transgender people. By its very language
and its endorsement, the bill reflects an animus toward those who are disfavored.
Moreover, there is not even a rational basis to justify the distinctions that are drawn in the
bill, see Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 632 (1997), much less the higher scrutiny that is
appropriate in light of this targeting.
H.B. 1523 cannot be justified as a necessary means of accommodating religion. In
2014, the State of Mississippi enacted the Mississippi Religious Freedom Restoration Act
(MS RFRA), Miss. Code Ann. § 11-61-1. To the extent government accommodation is
required for the religious beliefs that are endorsed and given special protection by Section
2 of H.B. 1523, those beliefs were already sufficiently protected by MS RFRA in a
manner which did not specifically endorse and give special status and exclusive
protection to certain particular religious beliefs. There has been no indication that the
MS RFRA was somehow insufficient to protect legitimate free exercise concerns. The
passage of H.B. 1523 in the absence of any indication that it was necessary to protect the

14

Case 3:16-cv-00417-CWR-LRA Document 7 Filed 06/03/16 Page 15 of 18

free exercise of religion demonstrates that the bill was passed for improper and
unconstitutional reasons.
II.

ABSENT AN INJUNCTION, THE PLAINTIFFS WILL SUFFER
IRREPARABLE HARM.
“It is well settled that the loss of First Amendment freedoms even for minimal

periods of time constitutes irreparable injury justifying the grant of a preliminary
injunction.” Deerfield Medical Center v. City of Deerfield Beach, 661 F.2d 328, 338 (5th
Cir. Unit B 1981) (citing Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976)). See also CSE v.
Bryant I, 64 F.Supp.3d 906, 950 (S.D. Miss. 2015) (citation omitted) (“[I]t is wellestablished that the deprivation ‘of constitutional rights constitutes irreparable harm as a
matter of law.’”). As explained in the discussion of standing above, H.B. 1523 clearly
violates the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs and causes them harm. Among other
things, H.B. 1523 conveys an impermissible, state-sponsored message of disapproval and
hostility to those who do not share the beliefs and convictions endorsed in Section 2, and
to those who are condemned as part of those beliefs, and indicates that their status is
disfavored in the social and political community of their own home state. See, e.g., CSE
v. MDHS, 2016 WL 1306202, *14 (S.D. Miss. March 31, 2016) (finding irreparable harm
from “stigmatic and more practical injuries”). See also Catholic League for Religious
and Civil Rights v. City and County of San Francisco, 624 F.3d 1043, 1053 (9th Cir.
2010) (holding that the plaintiffs had sufficiently pleaded injury in their Establishment
Clause challenge to a city resolution that “conveys a government message of disapproval
and hostility toward their religious beliefs” and “‘sends a clear message’ ‘that they are
15

Case 3:16-cv-00417-CWR-LRA Document 7 Filed 06/03/16 Page 16 of 18

outsiders, not full members of the political community’”). Unless it is enjoined by this
Court, H.B. 1523’s endorsement and special protection of the narrow religious beliefs
and moral convictions set forth in Section 2 of the bill will become the law on July 1,
2016. The harms faced by the plaintiffs and other Mississippians who do not share those
favored religious beliefs and moral convictions, and those plaintiffs and other
Mississippians whose relationships and identities are condemned by those beliefs and
convictions, is imminent and irreparable.
III.

THE BALANCE OF HARMS WEIGHS IN FAVOR OF AN
INJUNCTION.

No irreparable harm will result from a preliminary injunction to preserve the status
quo. It has been nearly a year since the Supreme Court’s decision in Obergefell v.
Hodges, 135 S.Ct. 2584 (2015), and the State seems to have survived just fine. To the
extent any free exercise problems arise, the Mississippi RFRA law remains in place. In
short, there is no indication that irreparable harm will result from maintaining the status
quo. Moreover, as the Tenth Circuit said when upholding a preliminary injunction
against a comparable law: “when the law that voters wish to enact is likely
unconstitutional, their interests do not outweigh [the plaintiff’s] in having his
constitutional rights protected.” Awad, 670 F.3d at 1131.
IV.

THE PUBLIC INTEREST FAVORS AN INJUNCTION
“[I]t is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a party’s

constitutional rights.” Awad, 670 F.3d at 1132. See also, CSE v. Bryant I, 64 F. Supp. 3d
at 951 (same). Further, H.B. 1523 is a divisive and controversial statute that has led to
16

Case 3:16-cv-00417-CWR-LRA Document 7 Filed 06/03/16 Page 17 of 18

economic boycotts of the State. Enjoining it and maintaining the pre-H.B. 1523 status
quo will be in the public interest pending a final decision in this case.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, and on the basis of the authorities cited, the motion for
a preliminary injunction should be granted.
