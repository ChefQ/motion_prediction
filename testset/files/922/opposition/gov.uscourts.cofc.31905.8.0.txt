PLAINTIFFS' MOHAMMAD KHALID BAHA, QUDSIA BADGHISY MOHAMMED
HAMID BABA, FARIA SAMADZADA FAHIMA AHRARY, AFIFA BAHA, TOOBA
BAHA, and KOBRA BAHA KAKAR OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO

siblings: Qudsia Badghisy,; Mohammed Hamid Baha; Fariha Samadzada; Fahima Ahrary; Afifa
Baha; Tooba Baba; and metherK 6bra- Bafa" Kalear to act on their behalf concerning this action.
Attached as Exhibit 1 is a true and correct copy of the Powers of Attorney granting Plaintiff
Mohammed Khalid Baha power to act on their behalf.

Plaintiffs join in Defendants motion to consolidate the case of Baha v. United States, No. 14-
494C (Baha I), with the instant case, No. 15-1349C (Baha 2). However, Plaintiffs opposes
Defendant's motion to stay the federal court proceedings on the following grounds:

1. After thorough briefing and argument, this Court ruled that Plaintiffs Mohammad
Khalid Baha, Qudsia Badghisy, Mohammed Hamid Baha, Fariha Samadzada, Fahima Ahrary,

Afifa Baha, Tooba Baha, Mohammed Tariq Baha and Kobra Baha Kakar are legal heirs of

Ghulam Bahaouddin, and as such, haye an interest in the subject property.

Dn Plaintiffs are informed that Defendant has indicated that this matter can be settled
for the amount of the past due rent, ($504,000.00). Plaintiffs are willing to entertain that amount
for settlement. Therefore this matter is ripe for settlement discussions.

Ss Although the Court has the discretion to stay proceedings in this matter, Colorado
River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 818, a U.S Supreme Court case,
mandates that abstention be invoked only under exceptional circumstances. Colorado River
Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, states in pertinent part:

"... Our decisions have confined the circumstances appropriate for abstention to
three general categories.

(a) Abstention is appropriate in cases presenting a federal constitutional
issue which might be mooted or presented in a different posture by a
state court determination of pertinent state law..."

(b) Abstention is also appropriate where there have been presented difficult
questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public
import whose importance transcends the result in the case then at bar...

(c) Finally, abstention is appropriate where, absent bad faith, harassment,
or a patently invalid state statute, federal jurisdiction has been invoked
Jor the purpose of restraining state criminal proceedings...

None of the above categories apply to the instant case.

CONCLUSI
For the above reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court consolidate Baha v.

United States, No. 14-494C, and proceed with the case, as it is very close to its conclusion.
