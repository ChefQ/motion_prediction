DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE AND STAY PROCEEDINGS
Pursuant to Rules 7(b) and 42

ofthe Rules of the United

States Court ofFederal Claims

(RCFC), defendant, the United States, respectfully requests that the Court consolidate, for all
puposes, this matter with Baha v. United States, No. 14-494C (Baha

I).

The undersigned trial

attomey has attempted to obtain the position of plaintifTs, through their representative
Mohammad Khalid Baha. However, he has been unable to do so because the telephone number

Mr. Khalid Baha provided in the complaint

assents to this motion.

Under RCFC 42, "[i]factions before the court involve a common question of law or lact,
the court may . . . consolidate the actions[.]" Both this case and Baha I involve common
questions of law and fact. In parlicular, in this case, plaintiffs allege that the Depaftment of the

Army breached leases of the Jill Fab House in Kabul, Afghanistan from Bahawoddin, or the
heirs of Bahawoddin, between 2003 to 2009, and20l2 to 2014. In Baha I, Mr. Tariq Baha
makes virtually identical allegations that the Army breached the same leases of the same

property for the same time-period. He alleges that he is the sole heir, and thus entitled to all the

rent. Because these two
period,

cases involve the same leases of the same property for the same time-

judicial economy would be best served by consolidating these

cases.

In addition, we respectfully move the Court to stay proceedings pending resoiution ofthe
lawsuit between plaintiffs and Mr. Tariq Baha in the Calilbmia Superior Court. Baha v. Baha,
MSC14-01927 (Contra Costa Co. Sup. Ct.). In their complaint, plaintiffs allege that they
instituted an action against Mr. Tariq Baha in Califomia Superior Court regarding entitlement to
rents onthe

Jill Fab house. During

a November

23,2015 status conference, Mr. Tariq Baha's

attomey confirmed that there is a case pending in the Califomia Superior Court case between

plaintiffs and Mr. Tariq Baha, and that the case has been scheduled for trial in April

201

6. The

electronic docket sheet for the Califomia Superior Court case indicates that a trial is scheduled

for April 4,2016. Because it appears that there is a substantial chance that the California
Superior Court case will resolve the issue ofwho is entitled to rent for the Jill Fab house, which
is a significant issue in the consolidated cases, this Court should stay the consolidated cases

pending resolution ofthe Califomia Superior Court case.

CONCLUSION
For these reasons, we respectfully request that the Court consolidate Baha v. United
S/a/es,

No. l4-494C,

and Baha v. United States,

No. 15-1349C, and that the Court stay

proceedings in these consolidated cases until resolution of the case among the relatives pending
in the California Suoerior Court.
