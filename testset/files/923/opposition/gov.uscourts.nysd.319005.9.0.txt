Re: United States v. Jerry Brooks
08 Cr. 35 (RWS)

Dear Judge Sweet:

The Government respectfully submits this response to the defendant's motion to
dismiss. For the reasons that follow, the motion should be denied in all respects.

Argument

The defendant has been charged with 11 counts of making a false statement within
the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the United States, in violation of Title 18, United
States Code, Section 1001. He has moved to dismiss all 11 counts.

Identifying the purported grounds for the defendant's motion requires close
inspection. Although the defendant provides an introductory summary of the grounds for the
motion on the first page of the motion, (Mot. to Dismiss at 1), that summary bears little
resemblance to the contents of the motion itself. The defendant claims that he moves on four
specified grounds, but only the first purported ground - based on the statute of limitations - is
actually developed in the body of the motion. The other purported grounds are never explained.
For example, the third ground asserted by the defendant is that the "indictment for the alleged
offense was not contractually required." (/d.) Read literally, this sentence makes little sense, as
it is obvious that the Government was under no contractual obligation to indict the defendant.
But if there is some other meaning to this purported ground for dismissal, the defendant never
develops it.

Looking past the defendant's introduction, however, it appears from the body of
his motion that he moves to dismiss on only three specific grounds. First, he asserts that the
prosecution is barred by the applicable statute of limitations. (/d. at 3-4). Second, he argues that
the charged statements, even if false, were not material, and that materiality is an issue that can
be resolved by the Court on a motion to dismiss. (/d. at 4-6). Third, the defendant argues that
his statements were "literally true," and, implicitly, he asserts that the Court and not a jury should
decide that this is correct. (/d. at 6-7). The defendant is wrong in all respects.

I. The Statute Of Limitations Does Not Bar This Prosecution.

According to the Indictment, the defendant made the 11 false statements at issue
in this case on March 22, 2002. (Ind. at 0x00A7 7). Thereafter, on March 22, 2007, a grand jury in the
Eastern District of New York handed down an indictment charging the defendant with 11 counts
of violating Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001. (See E.D.N.Y. Docket Sheet, Document
# 14 (Ex. A, hereto)). On August 2, 2007, the district judge to whom that case was assigned
dismissed that indictment on the ground that venue did not lie in the Eastern District of New
York. (See E.D.N.Y. Docket Sheet, Document # 30).

The statute of limitations applicable to the charges brought against the defendant
provides that an indictment generally must be brought "within five years next after such offense
shall have been committed." 18 U.S.C. 0x00A7 3282(a). However, Section 3288 of Title 18, United
States Code, provides, in pertinent part, that "[w]henever an indictment or information charging a
felony is dismissed for any reason after the period prescribed by the applicable statute of
limitations has expired, a new indictment may be returned in the appropriate jurisdiction within
six calendar months of the date of the dismissal of the indictment or information." 18 U.S.C. 0x00A7
3288. Thus, although more than five years had elapsed between the charged conduct and the
dismissal of the indictment in the Eastern District of New York on August 2, 2007, the
Government was afforded six months within which to bring a new indictment in a district where
venue was appropriate. This the Government did, bringing an Indictment in the Southern District
of New York on January 7, 2008.

The defendant does not assert that the Government brought this second indictment
outside of the six-month period provided by Section 3288. Rather, he asserts that the initial
indictment was brought outside of the five-year period permitted by Section 3282(a).
Specifically, he asserts that "the statute of limitations started to run on March 22, 2002 and ended
on March 21, 2007," making the March 22, 2007 indictment in the Eastern District of New York
untimely. (Mot. to Dismiss at 3).

The defendant misapprehends when the limitations period began and, as a result,
he misapprehends when it ended. The defendant asserts that "the statute of limitation started to
run on March 22, 2002." (/d.) In other words, the defendant asserts that it started to run on the
day of the event giving rise to the charge. (See Ind. at { 7 (alleging false statements occurred on
March 22, 2002)). The defendant is wrong. "The long-established general rule is that a statute of
limitations begins to run on the day following the day on which the event giving rise to the cause
of action occurred." United States v. Guerro, 694 F.2d 898, 901 (2d Cir. 1982) (emphasis added)
Case 1:08-cr-00035-RWS Document9 ~ Filed 05/12/2008 Page 3 of 14

The Honorable Robert W. Sweet Page 3
May 12, 2008

(citing Burnet v. Willingham Loan & Trust Co., 282 U.S. 437, 439 (1931)). "This principle has
been applied in criminal as well as civil cases. The general rule is that the day of the offense or
act is excluded and the day on which the indictment is filed is included." Jd. at 901-902.

Thus, the limitations period began to run on March 23, 2002, not March 22, 2002
- namely, the day after the false statements were made, not the day on which they were made.
And, as a result, the limitations period ended on March 22, 2007, not March 21, 2007. Since the
indictment was brought on March 22, 2007 - five years to the day after the date on which the
conduct occurred - the indictment was within the limitations period. See, e.g., United States v.
Nappy, 1995 WL 702363, *2 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) ("[I]f the mailing occurred on September 21,
1989, the five year period is counted from September 22, 1989, and the indictment, returned on
September 21, 1994, was returned within the limitation period."); United States v. Butler, 792
F.2d 1528, 1532 (11" Cir. 1986) ("Because we find that the conspiracy in this case ended on July
12, 1979, we conclude that the indictment filed on July 12, 1984, was timely.")

Accordingly, this prosecution is not time-barred and the defendant's argument to
the contrary must be rejected.

Il. Materiality Is An Issue To Be Decided By A Jury At Trial.

The defendant asserts that the Indictment should be dismissed because "the 11
documents signed by Defendant Brooks was [sic] not material." (Mot. to Dismiss at 5
(emphasis in original)). Citing cases from 1967, 1965, and 1963, the defendant asserts that the
"<ssue of whether the statement is materially false is a question of law to be decided by the
Court." (Mot. to Dismiss at 5).

The defendant is relying on overturned law. At one time, the law in the Second
Circuit was that "[mJateriality of a false statement . . . [was] a question of law for the district
court to decide, not a question of fact for a jury." United States v. Gribben, 984 F.2d 47, 50 (2d
Cir. 1993). In United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506 (1995), however, the Supreme Court
squarely confronted the issue, noting that regardless of what other courts may have concluded in
the past, id. at 515-519 (describing history), materiality in a Section 1001 case is an issue to be
decided by a jury, not by a judge, id. at 522-523. The Second Circuit quickly noted this
unanimous holding of the Supreme Court "that the element of materiality under 0x00A7 1001 must be
determined by the jury and not the court." United States v. Ali, 68 F.3d 1468, 1474 (2d Cir.
1996). Accordingly, the Second Circuit "overruled [its] precedents" and announced that "the law
in this Circuit now requires that for a conviction under 0x00A7 1001 to be sustained, the jury must have
made a finding of materiality beyond a reasonable doubt." United States v. Mandanici, 205 F.3d
519, 523 (2d Cir. 2000).

Because the materiality of the alleged false statements is an issue for the jury, the
defendant may not obtain dismissal of the Indictment before trial simply by challenging the
Government's ability to prove this element. A legally sufficient indictment "is not subject to
dismissal on the basis of factual questions, the resolution of which must await trial." United
States v. Alfonso, 143 F.3d 772, 776-77 (2d Cir. 1998) (holding that district court erred in
Case 1:08-cr-00035-RWS Document9 Filed 05/12/2008 Page 4 of 14

The Honorable Robert W. Sweet Page 4

dismissing indictment based on sufficiency of the evidence); see also, e.g., United States v.
Gambino, 809 F. Supp. 1061, 1079 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) ("It is axiomatic that, in a criminal case, a
defendant may not challenge a facially valid indictment prior to trial for insufficient evidence."');
United States v. Pisani, 590 F. Supp. 1326, 1333 (S.D.N.Y. 1984) (if indictment "alleges each of
the necessary elements of the offense charged, then it is not subject to dismissal on the basis of
factual questions, the resolution of which must await trial.") (internal quotation omitted).

Accordingly, the defendant's assertion that the Indictment should be dismissed
because his alleged false statements were not material must be denied.

Ill. Whether The Alleged False Statements Were "Literally True" Is An Issue To Be
Decided By A Jury At Trial.

Asserting that "`it is a defense to a charge of making a false statement . . . that the
statement in question was `literally true'," (Mot. to Dismiss at 6), the defendant argues that the
Indictment should be dismissed because the alleged false "statements he made were in fact
`literally true,"" (id. at 7). Once again, the defendant is improperly attempting to have the Court
resolve factual disputes that can only be resolved by a Jury.

The Indictment in this case alleges that the defendant submitted 11 forms to the
General Services Administration in which he certified that 11 of his employees had received
training that the defendant knew they had not received. (Ind. at {{ 5-6). Thus, the Indictment
plainly alleges that the statements at issue in this case were false, not "literally true." The
defendant clearly contends that the facts are otherwise, but that dispute must be resolved by a
jury. See Alfonso, 143 F.3d at 776-77 (A legally sufficient indictment "is not subject to dismissal
on the basis of factual questions, the resolution of which must await trial."); Gambino, 809 F.
Supp. at 1079 ("It is axiomatic that, in a criminal case, a defendant may not challenge a facially
valid indictment prior to trial for insufficient evidence."); Pisani, 590 F. Supp. at 1326 af
indictment "alleges each of the necessary elements of the offense charged, then it is not subject to
dismissal on the basis of factual questions, the resolution of which must await trial.") (internal
quotation omitted).

Accordingly, the defendant's assertion that the Indictment must be dismissed
because the false statements alleged therein were "literally true" must be rejected.

Conclusion

For the foregoing reasons, the defendant's motion to dismiss the Indictment
should be denied in its entirety.
