STANDARD OF REVIEW FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

The party moving for summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
56 bears the burden of establishing that its opponent has failed to raise a genuine issue of
material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 8.Ct. 2548, 2553, 91
L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). Rule 56 first imposes a burden of production on the moving party to
make a prima facie showing that it is entitled to summary judgment. In a case in which
the nonmoving party bears the ultimate burden of persuasion at trial--such as this casc--
the movant might satisfy its burden shifting obligation by either: (1) submitting
evidentiary documents that negate the existence of some material element of the
opponent's claim or defense; or (2) demonstrating that the evidence in the record
insufficiently supports an essential element of the opponent's claim or defense. If (and
only if) the movant satisfies this prima facie obligation, the movant will have sufficiently
"shifted" the summary judgment burden to the nonmovant--to demonstrate that summary
judgment is actually inappropriate. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-327,

106,

Under the Federal Rules: Defining Genuine Issues of Material Fact, 99 F.R.D. 465,
467 (1984)). Nevertheless, just as settled is the principle that, when viewing summary
judgment motions, courts must be vigilant in determining whether either an inference or
circumstantial evidence might suffice to create the existence of a factual dispute about the
~
claims--lest courts "use summary judgment as a 'catch penny contrivance to take unwary

litigants into [their] toils and deprive [the litigants] of a trial [to which they are actually

entitled].'" Fontenot v. Upjohn, 780 F.2d 1190, 1197 (5th Cir.1986) (quoting William W.
Schwarzer, Summary judgment Under the Federal Rules: Defining Genuine Issues of
Material Fact, 99 F.R.D. 465, 466 (1984), which in turns quotes Whitaker v. Coleman,
115 F.2d 305, 307 (5th Cir.1940)). See also Anderson v, Liberty Lobby, Inc., 4/1 U.5.
242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) ("al We summary judgment stage
the judge's function is not himself to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the
matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial."); id. at 251-252, 106
0x00A7.Ct. at 2511-12 ("the inquiry ... is ... whether the evidence presents a sufficient
disagreement to require submission to ajury or whether it is so one-sided that one party
must prevail as a matter of Jaw."). Indeed, a court's determination of a summary judgment
motion--whether thete exist genuine issues of material fact--requires deference to the
nonmoving party. See Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 158-159, 90 5.Ct.
1598, 1609, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970) (any doubt as to the existence of a genuine issue for
trial should be resolved against the moving party); United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369
U.S. 654, 655, 82 8.Ct. 993, 8 L.Ed. 2d 176 (1962) ("[o]n summary judgment the
infotonces to be drawn from the underlying facts ... must be viewed in the light most
favorable to the party opposing the motion."). See also e.g., Jones v. Southern Marine &
Aviation Underwriters Inc., 888 F.2d 358, 360 (Sth Cir.1989) ("fact questions are
considered with deference to the nonmovant."); Archie v. Mlinois Central Gulf Railroad
Co., 709 F.2d 287, 288 (Sth Cir.1983) ("In reviewing a district court's grant of summary
judgment, we are required to consider the evidence "in the light most favorable to the
party resisting the motion.' ") (quoting Trevino v. Celanese Corp., 701 F.2d 397, 407 (3th

Cir.1983); FED.R.CIV.P. 56); In re Japanese Electronic Products Antitrust Litigation,
A2/G5/2818 28:17 6463719765 PAGE @5/a7
Case 1:08-cv-03356-RJS Document 74 Filed 02/05/2010 Page 5 of 7

723 F.2d 238 (3rd Cir.1983) ("{i]f... there is any evidence in the record from any source
from which a reasonable inference in the [nonmoving party's] favor may be drawn, the
moving party simply cannot obtain a summary judgment..."), rev'd on other grounds sub
nom, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 374, 106 8.Ct.

1348, 89 L-Ed.2d 538 (1986).

In the instant casc not only should the facts be determined in the light most
favorable to the nontioving party but also whether the evidence presents a sufficient
disagreement to require submission to a jury. The inconsistencies of the defendants'
assertions, which is totally contrary to what the plaintiff has stated does, indeed raise

sufficient disagreement to deny this motion for summary judgment.

CONCLUSION

Respectfully subruitied to this Honorable Court, after reviewing the extensive
documentation of the defendants and the pointed documentation of the plaintiff, it is very
x
evident that this matter needs to be tried by a jury because of an intrinsic dispute of the

facts.
