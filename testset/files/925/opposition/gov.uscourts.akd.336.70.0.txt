1. This is a civil action brought by the United States, pursuant to Sections 7401 and 7403
of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.), to reduce to judgment federal tax assessments against
defendant Donald L. Hymes and foreclose federal tax liens against certain real property.
2. The real property that is the subject of this action (the subject property) is located at
2340 Ravenwood, Fairbanks, Alaska and is legally described as follows:
Lot Fifty(50) 0f Section Fourteen (14), Township One South, Range Two West,
Fairbanks Meridian Subject to reservations, restrictions and easements of record
3. In initiating a civil action to foreclose federal tax liens, the United States is required to
name as a defendant all persons who may have liens upon or claim an interest in the property
that is the subject of the action. See 26 U.S.C. § 7403(b). For this reason, and upon information
and belief, the United States named Charla Hymes (a.k.a. “Charla Hymes [Rayburn]”), in her
capacity as trustee of the Aurora Trust, a defendant in this action.
4. In her “Motion of Misjoinder,” defendant Charla Hymes represents that neither she
nor Aurora Trust has any interest in the subject property. Based upon that representation, the
United States does not oppose the dismissal of Aurora Trust and its trustee Charla Hymes from
this action.
Accordingly, the United States respectfully requests that the Court order that Aurora
Trust and its trustee Charla Hymes has no interest in the subject property and is dismissed as a
party from this action.
