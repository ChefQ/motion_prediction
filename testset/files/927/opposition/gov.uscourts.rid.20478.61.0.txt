MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF SHIRLEY SCHUMACHER’S
OBJECTION TO DEFENDANTS' JOINT MOTION TO STRIKE HER AFFIDAVITS AND

The basis for the Court’s Order striking these documents from the record was counsel’s
failure to comply with Rule 7 (d) (2) of this Court’s Local Rules. Local Rule Cv 7 (d) (2)
provides that, “before filing or objecting to any motion, counsel shall determine what page
limits, if any have been set by [the judicial officer to whom the case is assigned].”
Here, the Defendants and Plaintiff had filed motions to exceed page limits with respect to
exhibits submitted in support of, and opposition to defendants Fairfield Resorts, Inc. and Core,
Inc.’s motions for summary judgment. Shortly thereafter and before the Court had ruled on
Defendant’s and Plaintiff’s motions to exceed page limitations, the Defendants’ filed their
respective Motions for Summary Judgment and Plaintiff had filed her Objections to those
motions. This Court responded by denying the motions to exceed page limitations.
Pursuant to the August 22, 2006 Order, the parties were permitted to supplement their
filings with affidavits and/or exhibits that complied with the page limits set forth in the Pretrial
Order.
Pursuant to the August 22, 2006 Order, On September 22, 2006 Plaintiff submitted her
revised filings in support of her Opposition to the Motions for Summary Judgment filed by the
Defendants. She amended each of her exhibits and affidavits to twenty (20) pages or less to
comply with both the Court’s August 22, 2006 Order and Chief Judge Torres’ Pretrial Order.
The Defendants’ define Chief Judge Torres’ Order as limiting the Plaintiff to a total of
twenty (20) pages of documentary evidence in support of her opposition to their respective
Motions for Summary Judgment. Plaintiff submits that this definition by Defendants’ is
restrictive and does not comply with Chief Judge Torres’ Pretrial Order. Moreover, Defendants’
definition would unreasonably limit her ability to adequately support her oppositions to
Defendants’ respective motions for summary judgment.

Plaintiff therefore request that Defendants’ joint motion to strike the affidavits and
exhibits filed in support of her oppositions to Defendants’ respective motions for summary
judgment be denied.
