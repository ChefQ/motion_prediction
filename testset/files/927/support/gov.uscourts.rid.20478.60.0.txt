MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANTS FAIRFIELD RESORTS,
INC. AND CORE INC.’S JOINT MOTION TO STRIKE PLAINTIFF’S AFFIDAVITS
AND EXHIBITS FILED IN SUPPORT OF HER OPPOSITIONS TO DEFENDANTS’
MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Defendants Fairfield Resorts, Inc. (“Fairfield”) and CORE Inc. (“CORE”) (collectively,
“Defendants”) hereby move to strike the affidavits and exhibits filed by Plaintiff Shirley
Schumacher (“Plaintiff”) in support of her oppositions to Defendants’ motions for summary
judgment.
On August 22, 2006, this Court issued an Order striking the exhibits and affidavits filed
by Fairfield, and its co-defendant, CORE, in support of their respective motions for summary
judgment. (A copy of that Order is attached hereto as Exhibit A). As part of that Order, the
Court further ordered stricken the exhibits appended to Plaintiff’s Opposition to the Defendants’
motions for summary judgment. The basis for striking these documents from the record was
counsel’s failure to comply with the page limits set forth in Chief Judge Torres’ Pretrial Order.
Pursuant to the Order, the parties were permitted to supplement their filings with affidavits
and/or exhibits that complied with the page limits set forth in the Pretrial Order.

Pursuant to the August 22, 2006 Order, on September 6, 2006, CORE filed an Affidavit
of Andrew J. Bernstein, replacing its previously filed affidavit. Similarly, on September 7, 2006,
Fairfield submitted an Amended Statement of Undisputed Facts, which reduced the number of
documents submitted in support of its Motion for Summary Judgment to comply with both the
Court’s August 22, 2006 Order and Chief Judge Torres’ Pretrial Order. Accordingly, Fairfield
organized its filing so as to limit its documentary support for its motion to twenty (20) pages.
On or about September 22, 2006, Plaintiff submitted her revised filings in support of her
Opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment. However, despite the directives of the August
22, 2006 Order, Plaintiff filed approximately one-hundred-and-twenty (120) pages in support of
her Opposition. According to Chief Judge Torres’ Pretrial Order, Plaintiff was only permitted to
file twenty (20) pages of documentary evidence in support of a response to a dispositive motion.
Consequently, Plaintiff has again failed to comply with the orders of this Court regarding the
filings that may be submitted in response to a motion for summary judgment. Because the
Plaintiff has refused to comply with the Court’s orders, Defendants have been prejudiced.
Defendants therefore submit that Plaintiff’s exhibits and affidavits in support of her oppositions
to Fairfield’s Motion for Summary Judgment and CORE’s Motion for Summary Judgment
should be stricken.
