Civil Action No. B-02-154

DEFENDANT’S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR
RECONSIDERATION OF PLAINTIFF’S SECOND MOTION TO COMPEL DISCOVERY
AND MOTION FOR IN-CAMERA INSPECTION
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:
The United States of America, Defendant herein, responds to “Plaintiff’s Motion for
Reconsideration of Plaintiff’s Second Motion to Compel Discovery and Motion for InCamera Inspection” as follows:
1.

In “Plaintiff’s Second Motion to Compel Discovery and Motion for In-Camera

Inspection”, Plaintiff raised ten issues pertaining to discovery for resolution by this Court.
In this motion seeking reconsideration of its decision pertaining to those ten issues, Plaintiff
focuses primarily on the Court’s decision pertaining to “Section 3" of his second motion to
compel. At Section 3 of his second motion to compel, Plaintiff asserted that the Defendant
failed to produce videotape or still photographs relating to the incident at issue in this
lawsuit.
2.

Defendant provided the following response to section 3 of “Plaintiff’s Second

Motion to Compel Discovery and Motion for In-Camera Inspection”:
At section 3 of his motion, Plaintiff seeks copies of still photos that were obtained
for the purposes of criminal prosecution of those involved in the assault of the
plaintiff. These still photos were obtained from videotapes of the incident by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)–the agency assigned to investigate the
incident. When Plaintiff initially made his request for these photographs, the

undersigned contacted officials with the FBI and was advised that these still
photographs could not be located. FBI officials contacted the prosecutor that
handled the criminal cases related to this incident and the prosecutor indicated that
he no longer had the photographs. It is speculated that these photographs were
destroyed as part of the normal course of business that follows the
completion/closing of a case file in the United States Attorney’s Office. This
information was verbally communicated to Plaintiff’s counsel and was reiterated by
Defendant in its response to Plaintiff’s initial Motion to Compel. Also at section 3 of
his motion, Plaintiff asserts that the Defendant should isolate the videotape from the
camera(s) depicting the incident at issue. This is the first time Plaintiff sought this
type of video tape. The Defendant objects to this request. As Plaintiff
acknowledges, the Defendant did produce the video taken of the incident; the video
produced to the Plaintiff is the same video the Defendant currently has in its
possession. The original video is (and has been) available to Plaintiff’s counsel, and
if he desires to obtain still photos or hire someone to isolate the footage he wants,
he is free to do so at his own expense. Defendant should not be forced to prepare
his case for him and incur the costs of same.
Further, should the Defendant decide that it needs to obtain an “isolated
video” in preparation of its defense in this case, the Defendant objects to the
discovery of this “isolated video” on the ground that it would constitute attorney work
product.

3.

Defendant would supplement this response by stating that it has made a

another request for a search of records in both the United States Attorney’s Office and the
Federal Bureau of Investigation. Should any additional photgraphs or videotapes be
located in relation to this incident, they will be turned over to the Plaintiff in accordance with
its obligations under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
4.

At paragraph 4 of his motion to reconsider, Plaintiff asks for the the U.S.

Attorney’s Office criminal file related to the prosecution of Plaintiff’s assailants. A copy of
the criminal file was provided to Plaintiff’s counsel as a result of his second request for
production of documents that was served on the Defendant May 17, 2006. At the time
Plaintiff sought the criminal file relating to the prosecution of Plaintiff’s assailants, the file
had already been closed by the United States Attorney’s Office. As part of the United
States Attorney’s Office procedure in closing the file, all exhibits and witness statements
were either destroyed or returned to the investigating agency.

No photographs,

videotapes, or witness statements were contained within that file, and as such none were
provided as a result of that request1.
5.

However, Defendant urges that Plaintiff has not been denied accessibility to

information pertaining to witnesses or the ability to view videotapes relating to the incident
at issue. At the outset of this litigation, Defendant provided to Plaintiff investigative records
that contained witness statements as well as copies of videotapes that captured the
assault of the Plaintiff. Plaintiff has the ability, should he desire, to hire an expert to that
can capture still photos from those video images and/or prepare an isolated video depicting
certain angles of the assault. Defendant should not be forced to incur the expense of
trying to prepare Plaintiff’s case for him. Should the Defendant desire to undergo the
expense of obtaining still photos from the videos or prepare an isolated video from the
videotapes currently available, Defendant would object to producing same to Plaintiff as
they should be deemed attorney work product.

The crim inal file also contained pre-sentence investigative reports that were not turned over to
opposing counsel. Defendant objected to producing those item s on the basis of relevance, Privacy Act (5
U.S.C 552 and 552a), safety and security concerns for assailants and their fam ily m em bers, and the local
rules of the Court that said m atters are confidential and not subject to disclosure absent court order.
Plaintiff, however, does not appear to be seeking the release of these item s; however, should this Court
desire a m ore specific response as to these item s, Defendant will provide one upon notification.
