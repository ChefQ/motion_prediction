PLAINTIFF'S SECOND MOTION TO COMPEL DISCOVERY
AND MOTION FOR IN-CAMERA INSPECTION

 

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:

COMES NOW, LUIS ALEJANDRO GARZA, Plaintiff in the above-entitled and
numbered cause, and files this his second motion to compel and motion for in-
camera inspection and in support thereof would respectfully show as follows:

1.

Although the court denied Plaintiffs first motion to compel discovery and
motion for in-camera inspection, the court specifically did not rule on Plaintiff's
request that the court inspect four different documents the governmentis withholding
under the claim of privilege to determine whether they are indeed privileged and not
subject to discovery by Plaintiff. Plaintiff requests that the court review the

documents in-camera.

2.

Plaintiff in his first set of requests for production to the government, specifically
number10, requested "All videotapes or photographs related to the incident,
including the pictures of the scene where the incident occurred or injuries suffered
by plaintiff or other inmates as a result of the incident." Attached hereto as Exhibit
1, and incorporated herein for all purposes, is a true and correct copy of Luis
Alejandro Garza's requests for production to the United States of America.

3.

Based on information and belief there are video cameras around the
recreation yard where the assault took place which should have captured whether
officer Romero indeed patrolled the yard in the hour or so before the assault.
Attached hereto as Exhibit 2 is a U. S. Department of Justice document specifically
stating that a videotape of the incident clearly revealed an inmate, Garcia-Becerra
and several other inmates assaulting inmate Castro-Olivarez by striking him with
their fists and kicking him. The government has produced a compact disc which
depicts small bits of footage from approximately 10 cameras at the Three Rivers
facility in rapidly rotating order so as to be indecipherable. The government, through
its counsel, has indicated that the video footage of the area in question existed but
has either been lost or destroyed. This is very critical information, i.e., videotape

of the area in question within the hour or so before the assault. Plaintiff requests

that the court require the government to explain why it does not have this video
footage, explain who had it, and why its not available today. The government has
had notice of plaintiff's claim since at least August 1, 2001.

4.

On May 17, 2006, Plaintiff had hand-delivered to the government's counsel
Plaintiff's second set of interrogatories and requests for production, copies of which
are attached hereto as Exhibits 3 and 4, respectively. in interrogatory number 1,
plaintiff asked for the whereabouts of witnesses identified in documents produced
by the government. The government has produced documents reflecting the
whereabouts of most but not all of the inmates, specifically inmates who are still
under the government's control on supervised release. Attached hereto as Exhibit
5 is the email between counsel again requesting this information.

5.

In interrogatory number 2, Plaintiff inquired as to the whereabouts and
employment status of four Three River facilities employees working at the time and
place of the incident. The government has not answered any of this discovery.

6.

In interrogatory number 3, plaintiff asked the government to identify all

persons charged with criminal offenses as a result of the incident in question, the

litigation information and the Defendants' present whereabouts. These individuals

would have information regarding whether guard Romero was walking the recreation
yard before they attacked Plaintiff and others. Similarly, plaintiffs sole request for
production requests the contents of the Assistant U. S. Attorney's file who
prosecuted these defendants. This information has not been produced or
objections made. The prosecution's file probably contains statements and
photographs which are likely to shed light on the seminal issues in this case.
7.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays that after notice and hearing that Defendant be
compelled to answer the questions and produce the items described herein, and for
such other and further relief to which Plaintiff may be entitled.

Respectfully submitted,
