PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF PLAINTIFF'S
SECOND MOTION TO COMPEL DISCOVERY AND MOTION FOR
IN-CAMERA INSPECTION

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:

COMES NOW, LUIS ALEJANDRO GARZA, Plaintiff in the above-entitled and
numbered cause, and files Plaintiff's Motion for Reconsideration of Plaintiff's Second
Motion to Compel Discovery and Motion for In-Camera Inspection, and in support
thereof would respectfully show as follows:

1.

The court by ordered dated July 21, 2006 summarily denied plaintiff's second
motion to compel discovery and motion for in-camera inspection by literally
reiterating the language in its order denying plaintiff's first motion to compel save for
the last paragraph where, without explanation, it denies plaintiff the relief requested

in his second motion to compel.

2.

Plaintiff understands that the court of appeals has restricted the issues in this
case to whether guard Debra Romero was patrolling the recreation yard in the hour
or so before Plaintiff was assaulted. With this understanding, the government has
possessed videotape of this respective area during the relevant time. The
government has refused to produce this video footage which would itself answer the
question of whether Romero patrolled the yard as required under her specific post
orders.

3.

Plaintiff requests that the court conduct a hearing so that the government can
provide its explanation as to why its not producing this videotape and what efforts it
has made to locate this videotape or the photographs or still videos which may have
come out of the videotape, particularly in the prosecution of the assailants for the
assault which resulted in convictions at the Corpus Christi Division of the Southern
District of Texas.

4.

Plaintiff has also asked for relevant content of the U. S. Attorney's file in the
prosecution of these assailants as the file may well contain photographs and
statements of persons with knowledge of relevant facts as to whether Romero was

patrolling the yard, as required by specific post orders.

5.

Plaintiff submits that the court's refusal to allow him reasonable discovery of
critical information is a denial of due process. The court's rulings at this time leave
the government to decide for itself what information it will produce for plaintiff.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays that the court reconsider his second motion to
compel discovery and request for in-camera inspection and provide him a hearing
on the issues contained therein.

Respectfully submitted,
