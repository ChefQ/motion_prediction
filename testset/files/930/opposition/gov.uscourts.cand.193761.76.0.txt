J

HighpointeVillage, L.P., (hereinafter,"Highpointe") finds itself in this casebecauseit was

4

named as one of two classrepresentativesfor current owners of FHA-noncompliant propertiesdesigned

)

and built by the SpanosDefendants. Plaintiffs do not seekto establishFHA liability againstHighpointe,

"Knickerbocker") or
the other classrepresentative(Knickerbocker Properties,Inc. XXXVIII, hereinafter,

any current owner. Rather,becausecurrent owners may be necessaryparties in order to effectuateany

8

retrofitting relief the Court may order, Plaintiffs seekto join them in a defendantclass so as to have their

9

interestsefficiently representedbefore this Court.

t0

Highpointe'smotion to dismissunderFed.R. Civ. P. l2(bX6) is premisedon threearguments,

lt

none of which suppliesa basisfor granting that motion. First, Highpointe contendsthat claims againstit

12

are baned by the statuteof limitations. Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant

HighpointeProperties,Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss (hereinafter,

t4

allegesthat Plaintiffs are not o'aggrievedpersons"for purposesof the FHA, and thereforecannot statea

l5

causeof action under the FHA. Id. aL l4-I8. Finally, Highpointe claims that Plaintiffs have not

l6

establishedtheir standingto bring this lawsuit. Id. at 18-24.

t7

Second,Highpointe

Each of theseargumentsis rehashedfrom the four motions filed concurrently by the Spanos

l8

Defendants,and each can be disposedof on the sameground. Plaintiffs have alreadybriefed theseissues

l9

extensivelyin their ConsolidatedOppositionto the SpanosMotions, at SectionsIV.A and IV.B., filed

20

concurrently with this opposition, and incorporatetheir argumentsherein by reference.For the

2l

convenienceof the Court and other parties,however, Plaintiffs summarizetheir points herein.

22

First, Highpointe's statuteof limitations argumentfails becausethe Spanos-builtproperly it owns

ZJ

(Highpointe Village in Overland Park, Kansas)is part of the SpanosDefendants' larger pattern and

24

practiceof designingand building inaccessibleapartmentcomplexes.Plaintiffs have allegeda

25

continuingviolation of the FHA's designand constructionaccessibilityrequirements,with at least 19

26

violations occurringwithin the two yearsprior to the commencementof this litigation. Seen.2, suprq,

seekto bring all 82 apartmentcomplexes,including Mountain Shadowsand The Commons within the

2

purview of this litigation. To the extent the Court acceptsthis view and deniesthe SpanosDefendants'
"law of the case"to Highpointe's
statuteof limitations argument,it shouldnecessarilyapply this same

4

motion, and deny it as well. Furthermore,as the SpanosDefendantshave filed paperswith the Court

5

establishingthat the final certificate of occupancyfor Highpointe Village was not issueduntil September

6

26,2005, SpanosDefendants'Requestfor JudicialNotice [Doc. 51, Exhibit 134A], therecan be no

7

questionthat the statuteof limitations had not run with respectto this property when the complaint was

8

filed in this action on June 20,2007.3

9

Second,Highpointe'scontentionthat Plaintiffs fail to statea causeof action becausethey are not

t0

"aggrievedpersons"underthe FHA flies in the faceof establishedU.S. SupremeCourt and Ninth

ll

Circuit precedent.SeeHavensRealty Corp. v. Coleman,455U.S. 363 (1982);Fair Housing of Marin v.

t2

Combs,285F.3d 899 (9th Cir.2002); Smith v. Pacific Prop. & Dev. Corp., 358 F.3d 1097(9th Cir.

l3

2004). All of thesecases,binding on the Court and on Highpointe, make clear that Plaintiffs can

14

establishtheir right to sueunder the FHA without doing so on behalf of tenantswith disabilities. Indeed,

l5

"aggrieved person"
all three casesstand for the proposition that, at the pleading stage,Plaintiffs achieve

l6

"have
statussimply by allegingthey
beeninjured by a discriminatoryhousingpractice." 42 U.S.C. $

"discriminatoryhousingpractice"to mean'oanact
3602(i) 42 U.S.C. $ 3602(0 definesthe term

nn72-78, and becauseHighpointe's presencein the caseis only for purposesof effectuatingany future

22

relief orderedby the Court, this elementof Highpointe'smotion is prematureat best.

23
24

Finally, Highpointe contendsthat Plaintiffs lack standingto sueunder the FHA, parroting the
argumentsmadeby the SpanosDefendantsin their parallelmotion to dismiss[Doc. 48]. Plaintiffs have

2

judicial notice [Doc. 51] and renewedtheir previousmotions [Docs. 48,49,50 and 52]. It is to these

motions that this Oppositionresponds.
The FAC allegesthat the SpanosDefendantshave engagedin a continuing pattern and practice

of designingand building "coveredmultifamily dwellings," 42 U.S.C. $3604(0(7),in a fashionto make

6

them inaccessible

violations render all or part of thesecomplexesinaccessibleto and unusableby people with mobility

Basedon the SpanosDefendants'own Requestfor JudicialNotice [Doc. 5l], it is clearthat they

THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

DOES NOT BAR SUIT AGAINST HIGHPOINTE

I J

l4

Highpointe seeksto bar litigation againstit by assertingthat constructionon the property it owns

l5

was completedin 2003,Mem. at 3:6-8, and thereforebeyondthe limitationsperiod of the FHA. Mem.

l6

l1-14. But its argumentare wrong for threereasons.First, it appearsfrom papersfiled with this Court

l7

that HighpointeVillage did not get is final certificateof occupancyuntil September26,2005, which is

l8

within two yearsprior to the filing of the complaint. RJN Exhibit 134A.

l9

Second,if the Court shoulddeterminethat HighpointeVillage is part of a continuingviolation on

20

the part of the SpanosDefendants,then that property will be part of the litigation, notwithstandingthe

21

date of their construction;as a current owner whose cooperationin any retrofitting relief the Court may

22

direct the SpanosDefendantsto undertake,Highpointepresencemay be requiredunderFed. R. Civ. P.

ZJ

l9 and, thus, not subjectto the kind of statuteof limitations defensethat might be available to the

24

SpanosDefendants.Highpointe'smotion virtually ignoresHavensRealty Corp. v. Coleman,455 U.S.

25

363 (19S2),the SupremeCourt's controllingdecisionon applicationof the FHA's statuteof limitations

26

to allegationsof continuingviolation.

F.3d 1092(gthCir.2007),whichhasbeenaccepted
Broclarvay,_ F.3d _, 2008 WL 90233 (9th Cir. Jan.7,2008). In the interim, the Ninth Circuit has
orderedthat "[t]he three-judgepanel opinion shall not be cited as precedentby or to any court ofthe
Ninth Circuit." 1d Unlike the SpanosDefendants,Highpointehasyet to acknowledgethat Garcia is a
nullity which cannotbe cited to this Court.a Without Garcia, Highpointe's entire argumentwith respect
to the statuteof limitations relies on Mosekev. Miller & Smith,lnc.,202 F. Supp.2d492,494-95
(E.D.Va. 2002) and United Statesv. Taigen & Sons,Inc., 303 F. Supp. 2d Il29 (D. Idaho 2003). For the

Relianceon Hargravesis similarly misplaced. Citing to Guerra v. Cuomo, 176 F.3d 547, 551
(D.C. Cir. 1999),and holding that "[the continuingviolation] theory applieswhere defendantscommit

5

'repeated,but distinct,discriminatoryacts,someinsideand someoutsidethe limitationsperiod,"'the

6

Hargraves court held that the plaintiffs had sufficiently pled a continuing violation. 140 F. Supp. 2d at

7

18. Plaintiffs have pled that the SpanosDefendantshave committed repeateddiscriminatory acts,at as

8

many as 82 apartmentcomplexesin 10 states. As Hargraves teaches,that is sufficient to make out a

9

continuingviolation.

l0

Highpointe and Knickerbocker (and the classof current owners they would represent)are not

being suedfor violation of the FHA's designand constructionprovisions,but simply as partiesthat may

12

be required to effectuatewhateverrelief the Court may direct the SpanosDefendantsto undertake. In

l3

that light, there is no separatestatuteof limitations applicableto Highpointe and Highpointe. Their

l4

presencein the caseis, in a sense,will dependon the Court's determinationthat the continuing violation

l5

doctrine is applicableand that Highpointe and Highpointe properties are pafi of the litigation. It does

l6

not dependon the number of propertiesowned by Highpointe, or whether Highpointe was actively

11

at 15:1. From that faulty proposition, Highpointe contendsthat Plaintiffs cannot statea causeof action

Highpointe allegesthat "Plaintiffs do not allege to have been injured by the SpanosDefendants'
making a dwelling unit Highpointe village unavailableto a particular renter (or his associate)becauseof
a handicapof a particularperson." Mem. at 18. This point, borrowednearlywholesalefrom the Spanos
Defendants' primary motion to dismiss, can be answeredin the samefashion that Plaintiffs answeredthe
SpanosDefendants: Standingfor theseorganizationalPlaintiffs does not rest on an injury causedby the
fact that the Plaintiffs cannot live in a particular dwelling, as was the casein the precedentcited by
Defendants. Instead,as organizations,Plaintiffs' standingrestson the consequenceof Defendants'
design and constructionof inaccessiblebuildings, which frustratePlaintiffs' missions and forces them to
divert their scarceresources. Theseinjuries occur even though the organizationshave no interest or
ability to live in the subjectproperties. Of course,no court consideringorganizationalstandingunder
the FHA hasever requiredthe organizationto establishan interestin living in the subjectbuilding as a
prerequisitefor standingto sue under the Act. Defendants' assertionto the contrary has no basis in law
or fact.

l0

"aggrievedpersons"under42 U.S.C. 3602(i), and have
SpanosDefendants,nnT2-78,they are

Highpointe'scontentionthat "any claim for diversionof resourcesfor referring,consultingor

12
t3

l4

wished to live at eachapartmentcomplex suedupon," Mem. at2I, is simply not supportedby the two

t5

casescited by Highpointe. Highpointe'srelianceon GladstoneRealtorsv. Vill. of Bellwood, 441 U.S.

l6

91,ll2-15 (1979) is misplaced. The referencedportionsof that opinion dealwith the standingof

t7

individual plaintiffs whose standingderived from their proximity to the discriminatory racial steering.

l8

Plaintiffs in the caseat bar are not individuals, but one national fair housing organizationwith a national

19

serviceareaand four regional fair housing organizationswith their own defined serviceareasthat

20

include one or more Spanos-builtnoncompliant apartmentcomplexes. The injury that they suffer is not

2l

limited to any individual neighborhoodor community, but extendsto the full limits of their service

At least one federal court has rejecteda defendant'sattempt to defeatthe standingof a

Again, the fair housing organizationwas not limited to a constrainedgeographicalareaaround its office.
2

Instead,as a fair housing organization,the plaintiff was o'anorganizationwith a mission that is national

J

in scopeand breadth." Id. Application of that samestandardto Plaintiff National Fair Housing Alliance
is certainly warrantedon the allegationsof the FAC.
Nor is Highpointe'scontentionsupportedby TOPIC v. Circle Realty, 532F.2d 1273,1275(gth
Cir.1976). There,then-Judge(now Justice)Kennedyheld that "the role playedby defendants'alleged
racial steeringin denying the plaintiffs the benefits of living in an integratedcommunity may be so
attenuatedas to negatethe existenceofany injury in fact." In the caseat bar, the concreteinjury in fact
sufferedby Plaintiffs is pled in sufficientdetail to survivea motion to dismiss. SeeFAC nn72-78.

t0

The frustration of mission and diversion of resourcescausedby the SpanosDefendants'

ll

discriminatory design and constructionat as many as 82 apartmentcomplexesis sufficient to ground

12

standing. Highpointe'scontentionthat thesewere "self-inflicted," Mem. at2l: 20, is unsupported.

l3

Finally, citation to casesunderthe Americanswith DisabilitiesAct, Mem. at22-24, is immaterial

14

to the questionof whether Plaintiffs have standingunder the FHA. Binding U.S. SupremeCourt and

Ninth Circuit precedentprovide all the guidancethat is neededwith respectto Plaintiff s standingto sue
