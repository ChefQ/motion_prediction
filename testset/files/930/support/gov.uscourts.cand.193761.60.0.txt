NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION
TO PLAINTIFFS AND THEIR ATTORNEY OF RECORD:
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE THAT on February 26, 2008, at 1:00 p.m., or as soon

4

thereafter as the matter may be heard in Courtroom 3 of the Honorable Saundra B. Armstrong,

5

located at 1301 Clay Street, 3rd floor, Oakland, California, Defendant HIGHPOINTE VILLAGE,

6

L.P. (“Highpointe”), will and does move pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for

7

an Order dismissing this action, with prejudice, on the ground that the First Amended Complaint

8

of Plaintiffs NATIONAL FAIR HOUSING ALLIANCE, INC., FAIR HOUSING OF MARIN,

9

INC., FAIR HOUSING NAPA VALLEY, INC., METRO FAIR HOUSING SERVICES, INC.,

10

and FAIR HOUSING CONTINNUUM, INC. (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) fails to state a claim

11

upon which relief may be granted. Plaintiffs’ claim for alleged violations of the accessibility

12

requirements of the Fair Housing Act, as amended in 1988 (the “FHA”), on which Plaintiffs base

13

their claim for injunctive relief against Highpointe, is barred by the two-year statute of

14

limitations. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 3613(a)(1)(A). Additionally, Plaintiffs’ have failed to allege

15

facts sufficient to state a cause of action under the FHA, which is necessary to support their claim

16

for injunctive relief. Further, Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts sufficient to show standing.

17

This motion is based on this Notice of Motion, the Memorandum of Points and

18

Authorities, the Request for Judicial Notice, and upon the papers, records, and pleadings already

19

on file in this action or as may be presented at the hearing.

STEEFEL, LEVITT & WEISS

Filed 12/21/2007

I. INTRODUCTION

9

This far-reaching fair housing lawsuit is brought by five fair housing organizations with

10

respect to both identified and unidentified real property located throughout the United States.

11

Plaintiffs allege that the Spanos Defendants designed and constructed at least 81 apartment

12

complexes—containing more than 22,000 dwelling units located in 10 states—which do not

13

comply with the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act, as amended in 1988 (the

14

“FHA”).1 Out of these 81 properties, 34 “tested” apartment complexes allegedly do not comply

15

with FHA specifications and the remaining 47 “untested” apartment complexes are “reasonably

16

believed” to not be in compliance. What is more, Plaintiffs allege that the Spanos Defendants

17

also built and constructed additional non-compliant apartment complexes throughout the country,

18

the identity of which are unknown and therefore unidentified by Plaintiffs.

19

The majority of these known and unknown properties have been sold by the Spanos

20

Defendants to other persons, thereby giving rise to an alleged defendant class of current property

21

owners. This defendant class of property owners are not alleged to have violated the FHA.

22

Rather, Plaintiffs request simply that this Court enjoin the defendant class of property owners

23

from “failing or refusing to permit” any retrofits ordered to be made by the Spanos Defendants

24

with respect to the subject properties.

25

One of the alleged representatives of the defendant class is Defendant Highpointe, which

26

owns a single apartment complex, known as Highpointe Village, in Kansas. Plaintiffs’ claim

against Highpointe, however, is barred as a matter of law by the FHA’s two-year statute of

2

limitations. Ninth Circuit case law is clear that where, as is here, the alleged discriminatory

3

housing practice is the failure to properly design and construct a multifamily dwelling in

4

accordance with FHA’s accessibility requirements, a plaintiff must bring his or her private civil

5

action within two years of the completion of the construction phase. Garcia v. Brockway, 503

6

F.3d 1092, 1101 (9th Cir. 2007). Because Plaintiffs allege in the FAC that the construction of

7

Highpointe Village was “completed in 2003” (FAC at ¶62), this admitted fact alone shows that

8

Plaintiffs’ action against Highpointe is time-barred.
In addition to this action being time-barred, Plaintiffs’ claims suffer from two other fatal

9
10

defects. First, Plaintiffs have not (and cannot) state a claim for relief under the FHA because they

11

do not claim to be members of (sue on behalf of) a protected class or “aggrieved persons” under

12

the statute. Second, Plaintiffs lack standing to bring a claim under the FHA.

13

The FAC therefore is fundamentally flawed as a matter of law. Accordingly, this Court

14

should grant the instant Motion and dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims against Highpointe with prejudice.

The properties owned by the Owner Class Defendants and located in at least 9 different

8

states outside California are divided into three separate categories—“Tested Properties,”

9

“Untested Properties” and “Unidentified Untested Properties.” These categories are described as

10

follows:


11

Tested Properties: “Plaintiffs have identified 34 apartment complexes in

12

California, Arizona, Nevada, Texas, Kansas, Georgia and Florida (the ‘Tested

13

Properties’), totaling more than 10,000 individual apartment dwelling units, that

14

fail to meet the accessibility requirements of the FHA.” Id. at ¶ 3.


15

Untested Properties: “Plaintiffs have also identified another 47 apartment

16

complexes—in California, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas,

17

Kansas, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida—which the A.G. Spanos Defendants

18

designed and/or constructed after March 1991. [Citation omitted.] Because these

19

share common design features with the Tested Properties, Plaintiffs have reason to

20

believe that similar FHA accessibility violations may exist at those properties as

21

well.” Id. at ¶ 6.

22

Unidentified Untested Properties: Plaintiffs also allege that there are “additional

23

multifamily housing complexes, the identity and location of which are not yet

24

known to Plaintiffs.” Id. at ¶ 28.

Lack of personal jurisdiction over absent class members triggers due process concerns even in plaintiff class

each member of a defendant class.” Whitson v. Heilig-Meyers Furniture, Inc., 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4312, *49

III. LEGAL ARGUMENT
A.

Legal Standards Governing Motions To Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(6)

15

When a plaintiff fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, the Court has the

16

power to dismiss the claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). A plaintiff has failed

17

to state a claim when either (1) there is no cognizable legal theory upon which relief may be

18

granted, or (2) there is an absence of sufficient facts alleged to support a cognizable legal theory.

19

See, e.g., Navarro v. Block, 250 F.3d 729, 732 (9th Cir. 2001).

20

In ruling on a motion to dismiss, the Court “[does] not ‘have to accept every allegation in

21

the complaint as true in considering its sufficiency.’” Holden v. Hagopian, 978 F.2d 1115, 1121

22

(9th Cir. 1992). Rather, the court should “examine whether conclusory allegations follow from

23

the description of the facts as alleged by the plaintiff.” Id. “[T]he court is not required to accept

24

legal conclusions cast in the form of factual allegations if those conclusions cannot reasonably be

25

drawn from the facts alleged.” Clegg v. Cult Awareness Network, 18 F.3d 752, 754-755 (9th Cir.

26

1994). A plaintiff cannot rely on conclusory allegations of law and unwarranted inferences of

27

fact to defeat a motion to dismiss. See, e.g., In re Stac Elecs. Sec. Lit., 89 F.3d 1399, 1403 (9th

28

Cir. 1996).

STEEFEL, LEVITT & WEISS

Document 60

The two-year statute of limitations for alleged FHA violations bars Plaintiffs’
claim against Highpointe as a matter of law

7

On the most fundamental level, the FAC fails to state a claim against Highpointe because

8

the action is barred by the two-year statute of limitations for private civil actions under the FHA.

9

A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim may be based on the running of the statute

10

of limitations. See, e.g., Jablon v. Dean Witter & Co., 614 F.2d 677, 682 (9th Cir. 1980). The

11

statute of limitations for a private civil action brought under the FHA is “no later than 2 years

12

after the occurrence or the termination of an alleged discriminatory housing practice.” 42 U.S.C.

13

§ 3613(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added). When the alleged discriminatory housing practice is the

14

“failure to design and construct” a multifamily dwelling according to FHA standards, as is alleged

15

here, the statute of limitations begins to run at the conclusion of the design-and-construction

16

phase. Garcia v. Brockway, 503 F.3d 1092, 1096 (9th Cir. 2007).

17
18

The Ninth Circuit recently confirmed that the FHA’s two-year statute of limitations means
exactly what its plain language states:

19

[A]n aggrieved person must bring a private civil action under the
FHA for a failure to properly design and construct within two years
of the completion of the construction phase, which concludes on the
date that the last certificate of occupancy is issued.

20
21
22

Garcia, 503 F.3d at 1101 (emphasis added) (dismissing claims that multifamily dwellings were

23

not designed and constructed in accordance with FHA standards because the lawsuit was not

24

brought within two years of the completion of the construction phase).6

Page 17 of 29

1

Here, Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief against Highpointe is predicated on the

2

alleged discriminatory practice of failing to design and construct Highpointe’s apartment complex

3

according to FHA standards. See, e.g., FAC at ¶¶ 8, 40, 44, 46-48, 62 (RJN, Exh. A). Plaintiffs

4

expressly allege in the FAC that construction of Highpointe’s apartment complex was “completed

5

in 2003.” Id. at ¶ 62 (p. 27:2) (emphasis added). Thus, by Plaintiffs’ own admission, any claim

6

under the FHA with respect to Highpointe’s property accrued no later than 2003 when the

7

construction phase was completed. See id. Indeed, the City of Overland Park issued

8

Highpointe’s final certificate of occupancy on December 8, 2003. See Certificate of Occupancy

9

(RJN, Exh. B); see also, Garcia, 503 F.3d at 1096 (“The statute of limitations is thus triggered at

10

the conclusion of design-and-construction phase, which occurs on the date the last certificate of

11

occupancy is issued.”). Thus, any action alleging a violation of the FHA with respect to

12

Highpointe falls outside the statute of limitations period unless it was brought prior to 2005.

13

Plaintiffs waited, however, until June 20, 2007—three and a half years after the

14

completion of construction—to file the instant action. See RJN at ¶ 3. Plaintiffs then waited

15

almost another four months, until October 12, 2007 to name Highpointe as a defendant in the

16

action. See id. at ¶ 1. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ action—at least as to Highpointe—is barred by the

17

two-year statute of limitations and should be dismissed. See, Garcia, 503 F.3d at 1101; Jablon,

18

614 F.2d at 682.

19

2.

20
21

The continuing violation doctrine does not apply to Plaintiffs’ time-barred
action against Highpointe

What is more, Plaintiffs cannot escape the inevitable result of dismissal by arguing that

22

their action is somehow saved by the continuing violation doctrine. Plaintiffs allege in the FAC

23

that the violations of the FHA are “continuing” and “ongoing” in a transparent attempt to extend

24

the limitations period to cover their lawsuit. FAC at ¶ 50 (RJN, Exh. A). These allegations,

25

however, are to no avail.

26

The continuing violation doctrine may be applied only where a plaintiff “challenges not

27

just one incident of conduct violative of the [Fair Housing] Act, but an unlawful practice that

28

continues into the limitations period.” Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 381

(1982). The doctrine, which is narrowly applied, is appropriate only for “a series of related and

2

continuing discriminatory acts” at least one of which occurred within the limitations period,7 and

3

is limited to situations “where the type of violation is one that could not reasonably have been

violation did not become clear until it was repeated during the limitations period.” Moseke v.

The doctrine is not relevant here, however, where the alleged FHA claims would have

been actionable immediately upon completion. Design and construction, as a violation, is a

10

discrete act with a clear ending point—the date on which construction or design is completed.8

which is not an indefinitely continuing practice, but a discrete instance of discrimination that

terminates at the conclusion of the design-and-construction phase.”) (emphasis added). The

14

alleged existing inaccessible features are, at best, continuing effects of the initial discriminatory

15

act of design and construction. See id. at 1098 (“Although the ill effects of a failure to properly

16

design and construct may continue to be felt decades after construction is complete, failing to

17

design and construct is a single instance of unlawful conduct.”) (emphasis added). If the rule

18

were otherwise, “the FHA’s statute of limitations would provide little finality for developers, who

19

would be required to repurchase and modify (or destroy) buildings containing inaccessible

20

features in order to avoid design-and-construction liability for every aggrieved person who

21

solicits tenancy from subsequent owners and manager.” Garcia, 503 F.3d at 1098.
Hence, the continuing violation doctrine has been rejected where an effect is continuing

22
23

but the defendant’s act is not. See, e.g., Nat’l Adver. Co. v. City of Raleigh, 947 F.2d 1158, 1166

A second type of continuing violation is a systemic violation, which refers to an “ongoing discriminatory policy or
system.” Moseke, 202 F. Supp.2 at 504. However, the doctrine is irrelevant to this case because “inaccessible
features do not constitute a [discriminatory] policy.” Id.
8

If this were to the contrary, then Congress’s clear mandate that the accessibility requirements apply only to
multifamily dwellings designed and constructed after a certain date, 42 U.S.C. § 3504(f)(3)(C), would have no
meaning. The statute of limitations would be eviscerated.

934, 940 (6th Cir. 1999)(in a complaint alleging discriminatory allocation of sound barriers along

the highway, the continuing lack of such barriers constituted a “continuing ill effect” and was not

5

the result of continuing unlawful acts). For example, in Moseke, the court held that “a FHA non-

6

7

continuing effect rather than a continuing violation under the FHA.” Moseke, 202 F.Supp.2d at

507; Thompson, U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36981, at *8 (“the noncompliant buildings at issue in this case

9

constitute continuing effects of past discriminatory acts, not continuing violations of the FHA”).

10

The injunctive relief sought against Highpointe is premised on the discrete act of alleged

11

design and construction violations of FHA standards with regard to its apartment complex in

12

Kansas. Although the ill effects of any alleged failure to properly design and construct the

13

complex may continue to be felt, failing to design and construct is a single instance (if any) of

14

unlawful conduct. See, e.g., Garcia, 503 F.3d at 1098. As a result, the statute of limitations

15

began to run at Highpointe Village when the design and construction was completed in 2003, and

16

lapsed two years thereafter in 2005—almost two years before Plaintiffs named Highpointe as a

17

defendant in this action. See FAC at ¶ 62 (p. 27:2) (RJN, Exh. A); Certificate of Occupancy

Plaintiffs Fail To Allege Facts Sufficient To State A Cause Of Action Under The
FHA
In addition to this action against Highpointe being barred by the two-year statute of

21
limitations, Plaintiffs fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under the FHA.
22
Although Plaintiffs do not allege that Highpointe violated the FHA, their prayer for injunctive
23
relief against Highpointe is predicated on the Spanos Defendants’ alleged failure to have designed
24
and constructed Highpointe’s apartment complex in compliance with FHA specifications. FAC at
25
p. 40, ¶ D; see also id. at ¶¶ 79-85. Consequently, to the extent that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim
26
under the FHA against the Spanos Defendants, their request for injunctive relief against
27
Highpointe similarly fails. No such claim has been stated under the FHA, as demonstrated below.

Plaintiffs do not allege that they were denied a rental because they are disabled (a member

12
13

of the protected class). Plaintiffs do not claim that they were denied a rental because they

14

associate with handicapped persons (also members of the protected class). Moreover, Plaintiffs

15

do not sue on behalf of third party disabled persons. Plaintiffs do not allege that any person

16

having rights under the FHA has actually been denied a rental by the Spanos Defendants’ alleged

17

conduct.
In short, Plaintiffs fail to state a claim for relief under the FHA on behalf of themselves or

18

third parties who are members of the protected class.

As one court explained the meaning of an “aggrieved person”:
The Supreme Court jurisprudence applying the “aggrieved persons”
provision of the FHA makes clear than an “aggrieved person” is not
just any non-class member who protests what he perceives to be a
discriminatory housing policy. Rather, an “aggrieved person” is a
non-class member who (1) suffers actual injury as an ancillary
effect of present or imminent discrimination against a protected
class member and (2) challenges the discriminatory policy on
behalf of that class member.

Section 3604(f)(3) of Title 42 of the United States Code defines “discrimination” as follows:
(f)(3) For purposes of this subsection, discrimination includes-(A) a refusal to permit, at the expense of the handicapped person, reasonable modifications of existing
premises occupied or to be occupied by such person if such modifications may be necessary to afford such
person full enjoyment of the premises except that, in the case of a rental, the landlord may where it is
reasonable to do so condition permission for a modification on the renter agreeing to restore the interior of
the premises to the condition that existed before the modification, reasonable wear and tear excepted[;]
(B) a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such
accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling; or
(C) in connection with the design and construction of covered multifamily dwellings for first occupancy
after the date that is 30 months after the date of enactment of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988
[enacted Sept. 13, 1988], a failure to design and construct those dwellings in such a manner that-(i) the public use and common use portions of such dwellings are readily accessible to and usable by
handicapped persons;

Plaintiffs have not alleged that they are “aggrieved persons” because there is no allegation

of any “unlawful act” under Section 3604. For instance, Plaintiffs do not allege to have been

5

injured by the Spanos Defendants’ making a dwelling unit at Highpointe Village unavailable to a

6

particular renter (or his associate) because of a handicap of a particular person. See 42 U.S.C.

7

3604(f)(1). Nor do Plaintiffs allege that they have been injured by discrimination in the terms,

conditions or privileges in any rental unit at Highpointe Village. See id. § 3604(f)(2). Plaintiffs

9

have not alleged an unlawful act, nor have they alleged that they have been “injured by an act that

10

is unlawful” under Section 3604. Because Plaintiffs have not alleged that they have been injured

11

by an act that is unlawful under Section 3604, Plaintiffs cannot claim to have been injured by a

12

discriminatory housing practice. Therefore, Plaintiffs are not “aggrieved persons” and they do

The Complaint Fails To Allege Facts Sufficient To Establish Standing To Sue Under

15
The facts that this action is time-barred and the Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim

and a party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing standing. Lujan v.

11

Here, Plaintiffs do not claim to be disabled renters, nor do they sue on behalf of disabled
renters who claim to have been denied a rental at Highpointe Village or any of the other
properties sued upon. Therefore, Plaintiffs lack standing to bring this action.
The “full limits of Art. III” may, in certain circumstances not present here, allow an

12

organization that has been “genuinely injured by conduct that violates someone’s [statutory]

13

rights,” to sue on behalf of and “prove that the rights of another were infringed” resulting in harm

14

to that other person. Gladstone Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 103, n. 9 (1979). To

15

have a “case or controversy,” however, someone who holds substantive rights under the statute in

16

question must have suffered a harm caused by the defendant’s violation of the statute. Then, an

17

organization that has been genuinely injured by conduct that harms that third person may sue to

18

redress that harm. Id.

19

But Plaintiffs do not claim to sue on behalf of a person or entity (the class of persons) that

20

holds “substantive rights” under the FHA. Rather, Plaintiffs sue solely in their own right.

21

Therefore, since Plaintiffs do not allege that they belong to the class of persons protected under

22

the FHA, and do not sue on behalf of these persons, Plaintiffs do not have standing to sue as

Plaintiffs have not alleged that they “suffered an injury in fact - an invasion of a legally

Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61 (emphasis added). Instead, Plaintiffs’ “injury” is alleged to be a

The Ninth Circuit’s decision in Smith v. Pacific Properties and Development Corp., 358 F3d. 1097 (9th Cir. 2004)
is not inconsistent. The plaintiffs in that case were a disabled “tester” and the “Disabled Rights Action Committee”
(“DRAC”). After dismissing the complaint for lack of standing, without leave to amend, the district court in Nevada
denied DRAC’s motion for reconsideration. The court did not explain its order, nor did it offer a reason for not
granting leave to amend. Under these circumstances, the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the trial court had
abused its discretion in refusing to grant leave to amend, and that the plaintiff should have been allowed an
opportunity to amend. See id. at 1105-1106. This was consistent with the Supreme Court’s ruling in Havens, supra,
in which the plaintiffs should have been allowed to amend their complaint. 455 U.S. at 377-378. In Smith, DRAC
had “indicated that it would be capable of amending its complaint upon remand to clearly come within the Fair
Housing [of Marin] requirement on the merits of the standing inquiry.” 358 F.3d at 1106, n. 10.

Federal Practice 3D, §101.41[4]. Nor can litigation expense satisfy the standing requirement:
Litigation costs, even those that may be concrete and particularized,
do not suffice to establish standing. An organization cannot obtain
standing to sue in its own right as a result of self-inflicted injuries
that are not fairly traceable to the defendant’s conduct. Thus,
allegations of injury in fact based on the expenditure of resources
incurred in enforcement litigation fail to establish standing.
Expanding the definition of Article III injury to include an
organization’s litigation-related expenses would imply that any
sincere plaintiff could bootstrap standing simply by expending its
resources in response to the actions of another.

Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief against Highpointe based on the Spanos Defendants’

alleged violations of the design and construct provisions of the FHA. However, standing is not

dispensed “in gross.” Rather, a plaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for each form of

Before a court will order a business, such as Highpointe Village, to undergo the expense

of rebuilding or retrofitting facilities to comply with the FHA, courts first require that the plaintiff

show that he has standing to seek injunctive relief:

under the FHA. See, Oak Ridge Care Center, 896 F. Supp. at 872 (suits under the ADA and FHA
subject to same associational standing requirements).

violations related to plaintiffs “specific disability.” Id. at *27-*28.

Filed 12/21/2007

In order to establish an injury in fact sufficient to confer standing to
pursue injunctive relief, the Plaintiff must demonstrate a “real or
immediate threat that the plaintiff will be wronged again - - a
likelihood of substantial and immediate irreparable injury.”
[Citation omitted.] In evaluating whether an ADA plaintiff has
established a likelihood of future injury, courts have looked to such
factors as: (1) the proximity of the place of public accommodation
to plaintiff’s residence, (2) plaintiff’s past patronage of defendant's
business, (3) the definitiveness of plaintiff’s plans to return, and (4)
the plaintiff’s frequency of travel near defendant.

Document 60

Regarding “proximity,” the district court in Molski determined that the ADA plaintiff’s
residence was over 100 miles from the defendant Mandarin Touch Restaurant in Solvang,
California, a fact which weighed heavily against standing to sue for injunctive relief. Molski, 385
F.Supp. at 1045. In the instant case, Plaintiffs do not even pretend to have met the “proximity”
test: they allege that they are located in California, Florida, Georgia, and Washington D.C. and
that Highpointe, L.P.’s property is located in Kansas. Plaintiffs obviously fail the “proximity”
test.13 For the same reason, Plaintiffs do not allege, and cannot show “frequency of travel” near
the Subject Properties or likelihood that they will return to the Subject Properties.

And there is an even more basic reason why these Plaintiffs cannot establish standing to

2

sue for injunctive relief. Because Plaintiffs are not themselves disabled and because Plaintiffs do

3

not sue on behalf of disabled persons, Plaintiffs can never show a “likelihood of substantial and

4

immediate irreparable injury” to themselves. No Plaintiff (and no identified disabled person)

5

resides near Highpointe Village. No Plaintiff (and no identified disabled person) ever attempted

to rent an apartment at Highpointe Village. No Plaintiff (and no identified disabled person) plans

to rent at Highpointe Village.

In short, Plaintiffs fail to allege any facts that demonstrate that they (or any identified
disabled person) will likely suffer “substantial and immediate irreparable injury.”

may be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).
