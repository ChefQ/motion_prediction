v.
JOSEPH CARAMADRE
and RAYMOUR RADHAKRISHNAN
Defendants

No. CR-11-186-S-DLM

MOTION TO ENLARGE TIME TO FILE RESPONSE TO
GOVERNMENT’S MOTION TO DISQUALIFY COUNSEL
Now comes the defendant Joseph Caramadre, who respectfully moves this Honorable
Court that the time within which he must file his response to the government’s Motion to
Disqualify Counsel be enlarged to July 10, 2012. As reason therefor, the defendant states that
his lead counsel, Michael Lepizzera, is out of the United States during this holiday week and
unavailable to participate in the preparation of the response. The Government does not object to
the allowance of this Motion.
Pursuant to LR Crim. 12(f), the defendant agrees that the filing and disposition of this
motion and the period of enlargement if allowed, would constitute excludable time as defined by
18 U.S.C. Section 3161(h)(1)(F), as the ends of justice outweigh the defendant’s and the public’s
interest in a speedy trial.
Respectfully submitted,
JOSEPH CARAMADRE
By His Attorney,
