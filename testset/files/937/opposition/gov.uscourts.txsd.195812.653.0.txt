GOVERNMENT'S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS' RENEWED MOTION
FOR CHANGE OF VENUE AND RELATED RELIEF
The government, by and through undersigned counsel, hereby opposes the
defendants' renewed motion for change of venue and related relief ("Def. Mot."
hereinafter). The Court denied the defendants' original motion to transfer venue on
January 19, 2005. Memorandum and Opinion (Jan. 19, 2005) ("Mem. Op." hereinafter).
Now, on the eve of trial, the defendants reassert by and large the very same arguments that
the Court previously rejected. Nothing warranting reconsideration has occurred in the
interim. The defendants make no showing that media coverage of Richard Causey's
decision to plead guilty has poisoned the jury pool; nor do they show that the potential .
jurors' responses to the jury questionnaire somehow demonstrate that it would be
impossible to select an impartial petit jury. The defendants argue as a last-ditch measure
that the voir dire process the Court will employ to empanel the jury is inadequate. That is
wrong: the Court's voir dire process is fair and balanced and accords with Fifth Circuit

precedent, the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure, and the Court's own experience in
Case 4:04-cr-00025 Document 653 Filed in TXSD on 01/18/06 Page 2 of 14

picking petit juries.
ARGUMENT

The defendants' primary argument is that moving the trial to Atlanta, Denver, or
Phoenix is necessary due to local media coverage of their coconspirator's, Richard Causey,
decision to plead guilty. Def. Mot. 5 (describing defendant Causey's guilty plea as "the
most damning piece of recent adverse publicity"). They claim that because Causey
pleaded guilty after the Court circulated jury questionnaires to the jury pool, Houston
jurors will be unable to be fair in their deliberations months from now after hearing the
trial evidence. This argument should be rejected out of hand.

In the first place, the local media coverage of Causey's guilty plea does not
seriously prejudice them, much less demonstrate that ""prejudicial, inflammatory publicity
so saturated the community jury pool as to render it virtually impossible to obtain an
impartial jury." Mem. Op. 22 (citing United States v. Smith-Bowman, 76 F.3d 634, 637
(5" Cir. 1996), and United States v. Parker, 877 F.2d 327 (5" Cir. 1989)). The defendants
merely cherry-pick isolated media reports without regard to what has been on the whole
fair and factual accounts of the collapse of Enron and this trial. "(Isolated incidents of
intemperate commentary about the alleged crimes and their perpetrators do not rise to the
level of `inflammatory' where, as here, for the most part, the reporting appears to have
been objective and unemotional." Mem. Op. 12; see also id. at 13 ("[T]he news accounts

in this case simply do not constitute the type of inflammatory reporting of inherently
Case 4:04-cr-00025 Document 653 Filed in TXSD on 01/18/06 Page 3 of 14

prejudicial facts . . . needed to support a claim of presumptive prejudice.").

The defendants' own expert, Edward J. Bronson, acknowledges (although
grudgingly) that he reviewed "the relevant publicity over the past year" and that it has
"somewhat abated" since his previous two declarations were filed in support of the
defendants' unsuccessful motion to change venue. Skilling Supp. at 3 n.1. Consistent
with that, the defendants offer little that is new to bolster their claim that hostile media
coverage has poisoned the attitudes of the approximately 4.5 million people living in the
Houston area. They cobble together a handful of citations to Internet "blogs," Houston
Chronicle editorials or articles, and a documentary film, none of which suggests that the
jury pool is tainted. See Def. Mot. Att. A; see also Skilling Supp. Br. Exh. A. Only one of
the newspaper articles they cite even mentions Causey's guilty plea, and does that only in
the context of correctly anticipating the defendants' decision to renew their venue motion.
See Def. Mot. Att. A at 6,99. Two of the media sources the defendants quote are merely
Internet websites, see id. at 3, { 5; id. at 3-4, | 7; Skilling Supp. Br. Exh. A, for which the
defendants supply no readership information. The defendants quote at length from an
editorial that appeared in the Houston Chronicle concerning Causey's plea, Def. Mot. 7-8,
but editorials by their nature express the opinions of their authors, not the opinion of the
entire community. In addition, as the Court previously found, the Chronicle "reaches less

than `one-third of occupied households in Houston.'" Mem. Op. 16 (citations omitted);
Case 4:04-cr-00025 Document 653 Filed in TXSD on 01/18/06 Page 4 of 14

see also Govt. Opp. at 30 (citations omitted).'

More importantly, the defendants fail to cite a single precedent under which a
coconspirator's decision to plead guilty required a change of venue. That should come as
no surprise, as jurors are routinely trusted to correctly and fairly assess information
concerning coconspirators' guilty pleas. It is black-letter law in this and every other
circuit in the country that even before a petit jury - which involves a much more critical
point in litigation than pretrial proceedings - ""[a] witness-accomplice guilty plea may be
admitted into evidence if it serves a legitimate purpose and a proper limiting instruction is
given.'" United States v. Valuck, 286 F.3d 221, 228 (5" Cir. 2002) (quoting United States
v. Marroquin, 885 F.2d 1240, 1247 (5" Cir. 1989)); United States v. Borchardt, 698 F.2d
697, 701 (5" Cir. 1983) ("The general rule in this Circuit is that a witness-accomplice's
guilty plea may be brought out at trial... .") (citing cases from various circuits). Jurors

are presumed to make their decisions based upon the evidence presented at trial and the

 

' In any event, the extent of media coverage concerning Causey's guilty plea was
presumably comparable to the coverage of defendant Lay's own speech to Houston
business persons on December 12, 2005. In that speech, Lay called for witnesses to step
forward on his behalf, thus clearly indicating that he intended his message to reach the
wider Houston audience through the media. Far from seeking a change of venue at that
time, defendants affirmatively opposed the government's motion for a protective order on
all parties. See Status Hearing Tr. 20 (Dec. 16, 2005). The Court denied the
government's motion, reasoning that "this is just a drop in the bucket." Jd. at 21. If the
defendant's decision to speak to the jury pool through the media does not seriously risk
juror taint, then there is no reason to imagine that largely balanced, factual reporting
concerning Causey's guilty plea risks any taint. See Def. Mot. 22 (describing as
"instructive" the "Court's recent consideration of a gag order").

4
Case 4:04-cr-00025 Document 653 Filed in TXSD on 01/18/06 Page 5 of 14

trial court's instructions. See, e.g., United States v. T: arango, 396 F.3d 666, 677 (5" Cir.
2005) ("There is a well-established presumption that juries are able to follow the court's
instructions and compartmentalize the evidence against each defendant."). Thus,
especially in a case where the jurors will still be screened through an in-court voir dire
process, there is no basis for asserting that no potential juror could competently fulfill his
or her obligation once seated. To the contrary, jurors faithfully fulfill those obligations all
the time, including where they have knowledge that a defendant's coconspirator entered a
guilty plea.

The defendants claim that the responses to the jury questionnaires received by the
Court bolster their renewed motion to transfer venue. In this connection, they rely on the
aforementioned late-filed declaration of Edward J. Bronson. Skilling Supp. Exh. 1. The
Bronson declaration acknowledges that "over half (57.5%)" of the potential jurors
responded that they could serve as impartial jurors. He nonetheless opines that "that no
doubt significantly overstates what they would in fact be able to do." Id. at 5-6, 9 14
(emphasis in original). Bronson bases this claim on dubious and equivocal premises, such
as his assertion that "guilt percentages obtained in court through jury questionnaires or
voir dire are substantially lower than what is found in anonymous community surveys."
Id. at 5,411. But, as this Court observed in denying the defendants' earlier transfer
motion, "courts have commonly rejected such polls as unpersuasive . ..." Mem. Op. 19

(citations omitted). The defendants suggest no reason to alter that practice here. Bronson
Case 4:04-cr-00025 Document 653 Filed in TXSD on 01/18/06 Page 6 of 14

further argues that undisclosed taint is revealed by one potential juror who responded, "I
hate to say it, but I cannot image how my personal involvement in Mariner Energy could
not influence my involvement." Skilling Supp. Exh. 1 at 5, 0x00A7 13 (emphasis in original).
However, Bronson provides no reason to think that one potential juror's use of a stock
phrase means that the other potential jurors could not be trusted to fulfill their duties as
petit jury members.

In any event, even under the defendants' implausible reading of the juror-
questionnaire responses, they acknowledge that there are "70 or so jurors whose responses
do not disclose obvious bias . . . ." Def. Mot. 20 (emphasis in original)? Thus, the
defendants' own figures strongly suggest that there will be more than enough potential
jurors to seat a petit jury and alternates. See also id. at 10 ("Exactly 80% of the jurors, or

224 out of 280, expressed preexisting negative views .. . .") (emphasis omitted). There is,

 

* The defendants claim that even the roughly 70 jurors whose responses they
candidly acknowledge "do not disclose obvious bias" nonetheless pose "serious due
process concerns" because the jurors (1) may "harbor deep-seated, unconscious biases,"
(2) be exposed to media coverage during trial, (3) be affected by their "friends, families,
neighbors, co-workers, and fellow worshipers," and (4) may turn out to be "stealth
jurors." Def. Mot. 20-22. Defendants' rank speculation about possible present and future
bias fails to distinguish these potential jurors from those in any high-profile civil or
criminal trial. Cf Calley v. Callaway, 519 F.2d 184, 210 (50x2122 Cir. 1975) ("In prominent
cases of national concern, we cannot allow widespread publicity concerning these matters
to paralyze our system of justice."). Moreover, an instruction from the Court would
ameliorate any such supposed difficulties. Cf United States v. Williams, 573 F.2d 284,
287-88 (5" Cir. 1978) (affirming conviction for tax fraud where trial court properly
instructed jurors on legal matters and obligations).

thus, no compelling reason to change venue or award any other requested relief.

Earlier Enron-related cases bear that out. See Gov't Opp. To Def. Transfer Motion
(Gov't Opp.) at 20-29. In both the Arthur Andersen and Bayly trials - which were held
close to the intense media scrutiny that followed the collapse of Enron - juries were
empaneled in a single day. See Gov't Opp at 24-5 (discussing cases). Tellingly, neither of
those cases involved the extensive and searching jury questionnaires filled out by the
potential jurors in this case. Here, virtually all the questions the defendants sought to have
asked were incorporated into the jury questionnaire.` Thus, if anything, the jury-selection
process in this case should be more efficient, not less, than in Andersen or Bayly.

In the final analysis, the defendants' argument is premised on a misconstrual of the

 

> The Bronson declaration goes so far as to say that a mere 18 potential jurors are
free from "serious[ ] . . . doubt on their ability to be fair." Jd. at 8, 0x00A7 19. Bronson reaches
that extreme conclusion only by making the unwarranted wholesale assumptions that, for
example, there is "significant question" about the fairness of any respondent who
indicated that he or she was angry about what happened at Enron (not angry Lay or
Skilling) or had an opinion (either positive or negative) about Lay or Skilling. See id. at 7
(chart); id. at 8, J] 18-9. That is baseless. The fact that, say, a juror is angry about the
collapse of Enron does not mean that he is unable to judge the defendants fairly or even
that he thinks that Lay or Skilling is guilty. The responses show a more nuanced picture.
Thus, one potential juror responded: "Yes. Perhaps angry is not the right word to
describe my feeling but concern for those affected." Simply put, Bronson's conclusions
are vitiated because he conflates concern for one's community with prejudice.

* The defendants submit declarations from three (presumably paid) individual
attorneys who state that, after reviewing "jury questionnaire summaries," they believe that
venue must be transferred. See Skilling Supp. Exh. 2-4. None of these attorneys suggests
that he is familiar with the kind of extraordinarily detailed and searching jury
questionnaire sent to potential jurors in this case. One of them nonetheless states that it
would not "be impossible to find twelve fair people... ." Jd. Exh. 2 at 2.

applicable standard of law. The defendants are entitled to a fair jury, not one that has been
unexposed to media coverage or that comes to the case with no preconceived impression
of the merits. As the Supreme Court explained in its seminal decision on jury selection,
Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717, 81 S. Ct. 1639 (1961), "[i]t is sufficient if the Juror can lay
aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in
court." Jd. at 723, 81S. Ct. at 1644. The Court explained:

In these days of swift, widespread and diverse methods of communication, an
important case can be expected to arouse the interest of the public in the vicinity,
and scarcely any of those best qualified to serve as jurors will not have formed
some impression or opinion as to the merits of the case. This is particularly true in
criminal cases. To hold that the mere existence of any preconceived notion as to
the guilt or innocence of an accused, without more, is sufficient to rebut the
presumption of a prospective juror's impartiality would be to establish an
impossible standard.

Id. at 722-23, 81 S. Ct. 1643-44 (emphasis added). In short, contrary to the defendants'
underlying claim, "[n]otoriety alone does not indicate that a change of venue is

warranted." Mem. Op. 14 (citations omitted).0x00B0

 

> Defendants' urge the Court to grant a 30-day continuance to permit awareness of
Causey's guilty plea to "abate," Def. Mot. 33, but the Court has already continued trial for
two weeks and the defendants provide no reason to think that two additional weeks would
be helpful. The defendants argue that additional time would allow for the circulation ofa
new jury questionnaire that does not reference Causey, id. at 33, but there is no need to
excise Causey's name. Causey is not the only non-defendant about whom the
questionnaire inquires. At the defendants' own insistence, the questionnaire asks jurors'
opinions of Sherron Watkins, who will appear as a government witness. See Jury
Questionnaire No. 70(d).

II. The Court's Voir Dire Process Will Effectively Elicit Juror Bias And Accords
Fully With Fifth Circuit Law.

The defendants ask the Court to reconsider its ruling on how it will conduct voir
dire. The Court has determined that it will "question the jury and explain the rules of law
that apply and ask them a number of questions. If I think that individual questioning at the
bench is warranted, I will bring the juror up here. One lawyer per side may come up, and
we will explore the matter further." Status Hearing Tr. 37 (Dec. 16, 2006) ("Hearing Tr."
hereinafter). The defendants argue that this procedure is inadequate; they contend instead
that the Court should reduce or forego "general questioning of the panel" and that "[e]ach
juror should be questioned one-by-one in a closed courtroom, and out of the presence of
other jurors and the public ...." Def. Mot. 32.

There is no reason for the Court to reconsider its voir dire process. Contrary to the
defendants' repeated and erroneous suggestions, see Lay Supp. 1-3, the Fifth Circuit has
made it abundantly clear that "[d]istrict courts may use collective questioning to identify
jurors for which further individual questioning is necessary ...." United States v.
Beckner, 69 F.3d 1290, 1292 n.2 (5" Cir. 1995); see also id. at 1291 ("the district court's
discretion includes the decision whether jurors should be questioned collectively or
individually.) (citing United States v. Delval, 600 F.2d 1098, 1102 (5" Cir. 1979));
United States v. Chagra, 669 F.2d 241, 250 n.15 (5" Cir. 1982) ("The use of such
collective questions to identify the individuals possibly having knowledge about the case

followed by a separate examination of each such individual is entirely acceptable."),

9
Case 4:04-cr-00025 Document 653 Filed in TXSD on 01/18/06 Page 10 of 14

overruled on other grounds, Garrett v. United States, 471 U.S. 773, 105 S. Ct. 2407
(1985); United States v. Davis, 583 F.2d 190, 196-97 (5" Cir. 1978) ("Though separate
examination of jurors is sometimes preferable, it is not necessarily required. We recognize
the district court's need for flexibility in interrogating jurors as to possible prejudice.")
(footnotes omitted).

The Court's voir dire process is hardly unusual, even in high-profile cases related to
Enron. For example, in denying defendant Lea Fastow's motions for change of venue and
individual voir dire, Judge Hittner of this Court ruled that he would conduct voir dire by
first asking jury panel members questions as a group and then, "as need based the answers
of the various veniremembers, the Court will question certain jurors individually... ."
United States v. Fastow, 292 F. Supp. 2d 914, 921 (S.D. Tex. 2003). Judge Hittner
reasoned that such a procedure would "elicit fewer volatile responses, which might
jeopardize the sanctity of the entire panel." Jd. at 921. See also Gov't Opp. 26 (noting
court-conducted voir dire in Bayly trial).0x00B0

The defendants argue that the Court's voir dire process is infirm because "(merely
asking jurors if they can be fair is not enough." Def. Mot. 26. That point gets no traction
in this case. Here, the Court specifically requested the parties to submit questions that they

believe should be asked of the veniremembers. See, e.g., Hearing Tr. 36-37. Moreover, as

 

0x00B0 The defendants cite Local Rule 23.1, Def. Mot. 25, but even cursory inspection
of the Rule reveals that the voir dire process announced by the Court violates neither its
letter nor spirit. See Cr LR 23.1 (citing 78 F.R.D. 519, 532-33 (1980)).
