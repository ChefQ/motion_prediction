DEFENDANT LAY'S MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANTS'
RENEWED MOTION FOR CHANGE OF VENUE AND RELATED RELIEF

Defendant Lay relies fully on the Defendants' Renewed Motion for Change of Venue and
Related Relief and files this Memorandum solely to re-urge previous requests that individual voir
dire be conducted in this case and that defense counsel be permitted to participate meaningfully in
the process. (This request in no way diminishes our request that the Court grant the Motion to
Change Venue.) The sheer magnitude of the pretrial publicity in this case, the vast majority of which
is adverse, inflammatory, and unduly prejudicial to the accused, counsels that the Court conduct a
truly searching inquiry of individual members of the jury panel and that it be done in such a fashion
that other members of the venire are not tainted or prejudiced. (See Defendants' Renewed Motion
for Change of Venue and Related Relief - 27-28). While a district court has discretion to question
prospective jurors "collectively or individually," the Fifth Circuit "will find an abuse of discretion
when there is insufficient questioning to allow defense counsel to exercise a reasonably
knowledgeable challenge to unqualified jurors." United States v. Beckner, 69 F.3d 1290, 1291 (5"
Cir. 1995) (Emphasis added), citing United States v. Rodriguez, 993 F.2d 1170, 1176 (5" Cir. 1979).
As the Court clearly cautioned in Beckner, "we will reverse a conviction because of pretrial publicity

if the defendant can establish (1) that pretrial publicity about the case raised a significant possibility
Case 4:04-cr-00025 Document 638 Filedin TXSD 0n 01/11/06 Page 2 of 5

of prejudice, and (2) that the district court's voir dire procedure failed to provide a reasonable
assurance that prejudice would be discovered if present." Id. at 1292. (Emphasis added). The
Supreme Court held in Morgan vy. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 729-730, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 2230, 119
L.Ed.2d 492, 503 (1992), that

part of the guarantee of a defendant's right to an impartial jury is an adequate voir

dire to identify unqualified jurors. (Citations omitted) "Voir dire plays a critical

function in assuring the criminal defendant that his [constitutional] right to an

impartial jury will be honored. Without an adequate voir dire the trial judge's
responsibility to remove prospective jurors who will not be able impartially to follow

the court's instructions and evaluate the evidence cannot be fulfilled."

"Every experienced trial lawyer knows that the ritualistic global inquiry to the entire panel
by the trial judge is only the beginning in sensitive cases. The questioning that goes beyond the
opening ritual is the essence of voir dire. It is difficult for a venire person to confess such bias and
prejudice, when all the while he is likely denying it himself." United States v. Greer, 968 F.2d 433,
441 (5" Cir. 1992) (en banc) (Dissenting Opinion, Higginbottom, J.). Therefore, merely asking a
prospective juror "whether exposure to pretrial publicity affected their impartiality" is normally
"unacceptable" because it does not meaningfully and effectively ferret out jurors who cannot be fair
to the accused. United States v. Williams, 568 F.2d 464, 471 (5" Cir. 1978). Jurors who have been
exposed to pretrial publicity are simply "in a poor position to determine their own impartiality";
therefore, it falls on the district court to employ a questioning process that enables it to "make
independent determinations of the impartiality of each juror." Beckner, 69 F.3d at 1291, relying on
Unites States v. Davis, 583 F.2d 190, 198 (5" Cir. 1978). This can only be accomplished by finding

out what pretrial publicity or information the prospective juror has been exposed to (which would

include when and how often the exposure has occurred), and then inquiring as to "the prejudicial
Case 4:04-cr-00025 Document 638 Filedin TXSD 0n 01/11/06 Page 3 of 5

effect of the information." United States v. Gerald, 624 F.2d 1291, 1297 (5" Cir. 1980). What
should not be employed is a process based largely on the asking of leading or suggestive questions
or the making of statements to prospective jurors that ultimately undermine the purpose of making
the inquiry in the first place. Coleman v. Kemp, 778 F.2d 1487, 1542-1543 (11" Cir. 1985).

In United States v. Gerald, the Court held that "the time consuming, probing, preferably
individual voir dire described in [ United States v.] Davis generally is not required in cases involving
unsupported general allegations of prejudicial pretrial publicity or in cases where the publicity does
not create a significant potential of prejudice." (Id. at 1298). (Emphasis added). This case
represents neither of the above scenarios and, therefore, cries out for a meaningful, searching,
individual inquiry into the prejudices, both potential and actual, of those venire members who have
either been exposed to pretrial publicity and/or information about this case and/or have indicated in
their juror questionnaires that, for whatever reason, they either are biased or cannot clearly declare
that they are not.

We respectfully re-urge the Court to allow individual voir dire of all prospective jurors who
have been exposed to pretrial publicity or information about this case or who have formed opinions
about the innocence or guilt of the accused and that counsel for all parties be allowed to participate
in the process. The defendants' constitutional right to an impartial jury deserves no less. Morgan
v. Illinois, supra.

Defendant Skilling and his counsel join in this request.
