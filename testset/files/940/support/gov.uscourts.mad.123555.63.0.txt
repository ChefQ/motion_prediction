Case 1:09-cv-11267-GAO Document 63

Filed 06/02/10 Page 9 of 60

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
In September 2008, a rare virus — “Vesivirus 2117” — contaminated a bioreactor
engaged in a pre-manufacturing “process validation” run at Genzyme Corporation’s
(“Genzyme”) new facility in Geel, Belgium. The same unusual virus subsequently contaminated
two bioreactors at Genzyme’s Allston, Massachusetts manufacturing facility. In the wake of
these events, in June of 2009, Genzyme suspended production in Allston of two key products —
Cerezyme and Fabrazyme — in order to sanitize the facility. Inventories of those products were
not sufficient to meet patient demand, and the shortages adversely affected Genzyme’s revenues.
The Company’s stock price fell.
Separately, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has over the years conducted
multiple inspections of Genzyme’s Allston Facility. The FDA made “observations” to Genzyme
about certain production issues in 2008, escalated its commentary into a “warning” in 2009,
issued additional “observations” in late 2009, and ultimately executed a consent decree with
Genzyme in 2010. These regulatory matters had no effect on actual bulk production of Genzyme
products in bioreactors, instead primarily relating to certain “fill and finish” operations at the
Allston plant. But the FDA conditioned its approval of a new product to be manufactured at
Allston — called Lumizyme — on Genzyme’s satisfactory resolution of the “fill-finish” issues
the FDA had raised. At the same time, Genzyme continued to produce the product for
commercial sale as it always had in smaller scale facilities, under the name Myozyme.
Both of these circumstances unquestionably presented challenges to Genzyme. But the
plaintiffs seize upon these separate events, and mash them together to claim that Genzyme was
engaged in “rampant” violations of current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”), and
suffered from “woefully deficient” compliance policies, making “contamination outbreaks,”
“adulteration of its products” and “serious adverse FDA action” “likely if not inevitable.” And

1

Case 1:09-cv-11267-GAO Document 63

Filed 06/02/10 Page 10 of 60

they claim that virtually every statement Genzyme made for two years — even just announcing
quarterly results — was “false and misleading” because the Company did not simultaneously
confess to the plaintiffs’ charge, disclose every communication back-and-forth with the FDA, or
predict both regulatory action and unprecedented contamination events. The plaintiffs press the
conclusion that because adverse events unfolded, Genzyme purposefully knew, but concealed,
that they would actually eventuate. According to the plaintiffs, Genzyme “intentionally” omitted
to predict “inevitable” regulatory action and both the fact and consequences of contamination in
order to deceive investors and pump up the stock price.
But that charge depends on the coupling of regulatory “fill-finish” observations with the
extraordinary event of viral contamination, and exaggerating the result into an allegation of
“rampant” breaches of manufacturing standards. The Complaint then takes that essential claim
about ostensible “mismanagement” of manufacturing processes and impermissibly wraps it in
“disclosure” clothing, all the while ignoring what Genzyme actually said publicly throughout the
ostensible class period, in order to shoehorn a factually implausible theory into the federal
securities laws. And finally, the plaintiffs simply presume a guilty conscience. Without
attributing any conceivable motive to deceive to any Genzyme officer, they charge that because
the Company “knew” what the plaintiffs claim, it deliberately kept investors in the dark.
Plaintiffs’ claim is accordingly nothing more than opportunism masquerading as
securities “fraud.” The federal securities laws require more. Any complaint must include
“enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550
U.S. 544, 555 (2007), such that the complaint establishes “‘a plausible entitlement to relief,’”
Vernet v. Serrano-Torres, 566 F.3d 254, 258 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 559).
But a securities complaint must also “specify each statement alleged to have been misleading

2

Case 1:09-cv-11267-GAO Document 63

Filed 06/02/10 Page 11 of 60

[and] the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,” 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1) (2010),
and “state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with
the required state of mind,” 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(2) (2010), such that the inference of intentional
or reckless deception is “cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could
draw from the facts alleged,” Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 324
(2007). Those requirements are not met here. The extensive two-year fraud posited in the
Complaint is all speculation and no plausibility.
At bottom, the plaintiffs lift a series of facts disclosed to investors during (or even after)
the class period and allege that the information should have been disclosed earlier. For example,
although Genzyme announced in Spring 2009 that two bioreactor failures in late 2008 were
caused by viral contamination, the plaintiffs allege that Genzyme had a duty to disclose the fact
of a viral contamination sooner. But the pleading does not say what information Genzyme
possessed any earlier that would have even allowed it to make a disclosure; and they simply
ignore Genzyme’s statement that it took six months of investigation to isolate the viral cause.
Similarly, although Genzyme announced in November 2008 that the FDA extended the date by
which the agency expected to approve a large-scale production process application, the plaintiffs
simply allege the disclosure should have been made earlier. But when? And what did Genzyme
know that would have allowed it to predict the regulator’s delay? The entire structure of the
Complaint follows this same pattern: disclosures the Company did make during the class period
are used to allege — without more — that Genzyme had a duty to disclose the information at an
earlier time.
Quite apart from its failure to supply the building blocks of information that would permit
“earlier” disclosure, the pleading provides no basis upon which to draw an inference that the

3

Case 1:09-cv-11267-GAO Document 63

Filed 06/02/10 Page 12 of 60

failure to do so was intentionally or recklessly deceptive. Again, what Genzyme did disclose
corroborates the point: It strains credulity to assert that Genzyme would conceal from the public
information that the Company actually disclosed. For example, Genzyme:1


Announced to the public each time the FDA moved an anticipated approval date for its
products, including Lumizyme.



Announced to the public when it received a Warning Letter discussing the FDA’s
observations concerning certain aspects of the Company’s operations in Allston,
Massachusetts.



Announced to the public immediately upon deciding to shut down the Allston plant for
decontamination activities following the identification of a viral contamination of a
bioreactor producing the product Cerezyme in late May 2009.



Informed its regulators and the public when supplies of Myozyme and other products
became tight or unavailable.
The steady stream of disclosures and updates by Genzyme during the period — either

omitted from the pleadings or downplayed by the plaintiffs for obvious reasons — overwhelms
the inference of purposeful deception the plaintiffs simply manufacture. And there is nothing
else. The complaint offers no reason behind its charge of “concealment.” It doesn’t hint at a
motive or begin to say “why” Genzyme would risk failing to alert investors to material risks.
The pleading simply chalks up its claim of omitted disclosure to “fraud” without a basis, much
less particularized facts.
The Complaint also mocks the requirement set by Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) and the PSLRA
that each purportedly misleading statement be specified, along with the alleged reason why the
statement is misleading. See Aldridge v. A.T. Cross Corp., 284 F.3d 72, 78 (1st Cir. 2002).

The general rule that documents outside of the pleadings are not considered on a motion to dismiss does not apply
to certain categories of documents including, inter alia, “documents central to the plaintiff’s claim” and “documents
sufficiently referred to in the complaint.” In re Praecis Pharms., Inc., Sec. Litig., No. 04-CV-12581, 2007 WL
951695, at *5 n. 8 (D. Mass. Mar. 28, 2007) (granting motion to dismiss Section 10(b) claim and citing Watterson v.
Page, 987 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993)). Because the voluminous Complaint references and relies upon, specifically or
generally, a large number of documents ranging from FDA correspondence to Genzyme’s public disclosures, the
defendants have addressed these documents as necessary herein and have attached copies for the Court’s
convenience to the Declaration of Alison McLaughlin (“McL. Decl.”), filed concurrently herewith.

While the Complaint’s length is striking, the puzzle-like structure of its section purporting to
identify the alleged misleading statements and omissions, ¶¶ 216 to 320, is its most defining
feature. Across 104 paragraphs, the plaintiffs purport to identify the countless statements they
claim were “false or misleading.” But the format of the pleading makes a game out of the task of
identifying which statements are alleged to be false, and precisely how they are alleged to be
false. Several statements are identified in a series, see, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 216-219 or ¶¶ 237-240,
without any specific reason why each statement is purportedly false or misleading, and only then
is that group of statements — which may not be related to one another at all — followed by a
paragraph stating that all of the statements in previous paragraphs were false and misleading for
any one of several reasons offered as a group. See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 220 or ¶ 241. It is left to the
Court and the defendants to guess at which reason aligns with any statement.2
This chaotic approach to pleading itself justifies dismissal. See In re Alcatel Sec. Litig.,
382 F. Supp. 2d 513, 534 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). Given the time plaintiffs had to prepare the
Complaint, its confusing structure can only have been a tactical choice intended to give the
appearance of a broad scheme to defraud where a genuine basis for the claim is lacking. But
whatever the goal, the approach taken by the plaintiffs massively complicates the Court’s task of
evaluating the allegations on a statement-by-statement basis. See In re Credit Suisse First
Boston Corp., 431 F.3d 36, 49 (1st Cir. 2005).
Nonetheless, the allegations are susceptible of some attempt at organization. Close
examination of the Complaint reveals that almost 50% of the alleged misstatements specified
address Genzyme’s expectations for the timing of the FDA’s decision on approval of Lumizyme,
which was the name given to Myozyme in 2000L formulation. The remaining statements also
2

To assist the Court in solving the puzzle, the defendants have collected all of the purported misstatements in single
chart, associating each statement with the list of conclusory reasons which allegedly render each statement
misleading. This chart is provided as Attachment 1 hereto.

5

Case 1:09-cv-11267-GAO Document 63

can be grouped into distinct categories, such as (i) general statements of optimism, or puffery;
(ii) revenue guidance and financial results; and (iii) non-actionable forward-looking statements.
For the purposes of establishing the legal insufficiency of the Complaint for purposes of Rule
12(b)(6), the defendants have organized their arguments around these and other categories.
Once organized, the claims are susceptible to straightforward legal analysis. For
example, the central thrust of the Complaint is the plaintiffs’ insistence that Genzyme was
required to disclose “observations” made by FDA in connection with its inspection of the
Company’s Allston plant in October 2008 (and provided to Genzyme in writing on FDA Form
483). Indeed, all of the manufacturing conditions cited by the plaintiffs and alleged to have been
omitted from disclosures to investors are lifted from observations contained in the Form 483
received by Genzyme in October 2008. But the cases clearly state that Form 483 observations
by the FDA are not material and do not require disclosure. See Section II. A., infra. The
plaintiffs also point to the Form 483 observations and claim that Genzyme was required to
disclose that it was in “violation of cGMPs.” But the cases also clearly state that such violations
are established only at the time of an FDA enforcement action — not by the receipt of a Form
483 alone. See Sections II. A, B., infra. The plaintiffs cite nearly all of Genzyme’s earnings and
revenue guidance statements during the two-year period. But the Complaint nowhere explains
how such reports were wrong, or whether the supposedly “correct” numbers would have been
materially different — allegations which are required in order for claims challenging reported
results or guidance to be actionable. See Section III. E., infra. The vast bulk of the alleged
misstatements are non-actionable puffery or forward-looking statements. See Sections III. D.
and III. E., infra. Taken together, the assorted claims and alleged misstatements and omissions
simply are not actionable under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act (or Rule 10b-5 there under).

This case underscores the wisdom of the heightened standards imposed on securities
fraud claims by both Congress and the courts. Genzyme has faced countless challenges over the
past two years. In doing so, it has worked with regulators, stakeholders, patients and investors to
provide timely and appropriate disclosures to the public as events warranted. Even today, that
work continues.3 But companies are not subject to liability under the federal securities laws
merely because they experience operational set-backs and declines in their stock price; after-thefact assertions of “poor management” do not give rise to actionable claims under Section 10(b).
Santa Fe Indus. v. Green, 430 U.S. 462, 479 (1977). If public companies facing such challenges
can be routinely subject to expensive and time-consuming litigation and discovery on the basis of
claims which merely speculate concerning its motives and insinuate that disclosures were
incomplete or untimely, the Supreme Court’s decisions in Twombly and Tellabs, and other
standards applicable to such claims, have little practical effect. To be sure, the Complaint is
lengthy and artful, but it lacks any legal merit. It fails to state a plausible claim upon which
relief may be granted. This Court should dismiss it with prejudice.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Genzyme is one of the world’s leading biotechnology companies. Genzyme focuses on
the development of products to treat patients suffering from rare inherited disorders and other
serious conditions. The company’s Genetic Disease Segment has developed and manufactures
products that treat lysosomal storage diseases — a group of metabolic disorders caused by a
body’s lack of certain enzymes — including Cerezyme® (for the treatment of Gaucher disease),

3

While the Court need not consider these facts on this motion, on May 24, 2010, Genzyme announced that it had
finalized the terms of a consent decree with the FDA (and agreed to a civil fine) in an effort to address
manufacturing concerns raised by the agency, and on May 25, 2010, Genzyme announced that it had obtained FDA
regulatory approval for the sale of Lumizyme manufactured at the 4000L scale to patients in the United States.

Fabrazyme® (for the treatment of Fabry disease), and Myozyme® (for the treatment of Pompe
disease). Compl. ¶¶ 36-39.
These products are classified as “biologics” because they are created from biological
rather than chemical sources. Compl. ¶ 35. Their manufacture involves the use of bioreactors in
which the material that will be incorporated into the finished pharmaceutical product is “grown”
before moving through the rest of the manufacturing process. Id. Genzyme operates a number
of facilities worldwide that play some role in its biologics manufacturing, including at Allston
Landing, Massachusetts (the “Allston Facility”) and Geel, Belgium (the “Geel Facility”).
Myozyme and Lumizyme. Genzyme has produced Myozyme since 2006 at two of its
facilities: one in Framingham, Massachusetts in 160-liter (“160L”) bioreactors, which had been
approved for patients in the United States, and another at its Allston Facility in 2000-liter
(“2000L”) bioreactors, which had been approved for use only outside the United States. Compl.
¶¶ 14, 48. Demand for Myozyme motivated the Company to pursue the use of larger bioreactors
to increase production volume. Genzyme accordingly began to pursue production of Myozyme
at the 4000L scale at the Geel Facility and FDA approval of 2000L Myozyme produced at the
Allston Facility. Compl. ¶¶ 48-51. Because the Geel Facility was a completely new
manufacturing site, the process for beginning and obtaining regulatory approval for production
of Myozyme at the 4000L scale required completion of a lengthy “start up” phase. Genzyme
began this process in mid-2008 and obtained approval of the European Medicines Agency
(“EMEA”) to produce and sell Myozyme at the 4000L scale on February 26, 2009 — months
earlier than the Company had originally projected. Compl. ¶ 51.
Genzyme also undertook to secure approval from the FDA to sell Myozyme made at
Allston at the 2000L scale. See Compl. ¶ 48. After the FDA determined that Myozyme

8

Case 1:09-cv-11267-GAO Document 63

Filed 06/02/10 Page 17 of 60

produced at this 2000L scale should be addressed under a separate Biologics License Application
(“BLA”), rather than merely an amendment to its prior approval decision for Myozyme produced
at the 160L scale, Genzyme gave the 2000L scale product a separate name — Lumizyme — for
purposes of differentiation. Compl. ¶¶ 48, 49. In connection with the Lumizyme BLA, the FDA
provided Genzyme with a PDUFA4 date of November 29, 2008, and began its own inspection
process for the BLA, including a review of the manufacturing processes at the Allston Facility
that were to be involved in producing Lumizyme. Compl. ¶ 93.
The October 2008 Form 483. Between mid-September and mid-October 2008, just a
few months after the EMEA certified that the Allston Facility was in compliance with cGMPs,
the FDA conducted an inspection of the Allston Facility. On October 10, 2008, the FDA issued
a Form 483 to Genzyme, identifying certain “observations” from the inspection process relating
to Genzyme’s manufacturing operations (the “Form 483”). See McL. Decl. Ex. A. The Form
483 contains standard language advising as follows:
THIS DOCUMENT LISTS . . . INSPECTIONAL
OBSERVATIONS AND DO[ES] NOT REPRESENT A FINAL
AGENCY DETERMINATION REGARDING YOUR
COMPLIANCE.
See id. (capitalization in original). The bulk of the FDA’s observations were related to the “fill
and finish” manufacturing processes that are “downstream” of the bioreactors where Genzyme
later experienced two viral contamination events. See id. Nothing in the Form 483 addressed
deficiencies at Allston in detecting or preventing viral contaminations. See id.
Upon receipt of the FDA’s observations in the Form 483, Genzyme began to address the
observations and communicated regularly — and publicly — with the FDA. See Compl. ¶¶ 101,

4

PDUFA refers to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992, which requires the FDA to set goals for the amount
of time it will take to review an application. Compl. ¶ 93. Thus, a “PDUFA date” is the date by which the FDA has
informed the applicant that the agency will endeavor to reach a decision on the BLA.

9

278. Genzyme sent the FDA a voluntary written response to the Form 483 on October 31, 2008,
detailing the Company’s efforts to address each of the inspection observations and its progress in
resolving them. See McL. Decl. Ex. B; Compl. ¶ 100.
Extension of Lumizyme PDUFA Date. In late October 2008, Genzyme appeared before
an FDA Advisory Committee to discuss the results from Lumizyme clinical studies. In an
important step towards obtaining FDA approval, the Advisory Committee voted 16-1 in support
of the conclusion that Genzyme’s studies established the clinical effectiveness of the therapy.
McL. Decl. Ex. C. In November, Genzyme submitted, at the FDA’s request, its Risk Evaluation
and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”). McL. Decl. Ex. D. On November 17, 2008, Genzyme
issued a press release announcing that the FDA had extended the Lumizyme BLA PDUFA date
by 90 days, to February 28, 2009. See id.; Compl. ¶ 106. The FDA had informed Genzyme that
the extension was necessary to allow the FDA to review the REMS and to give Genzyme time to
design a post-approval clinical verification study. See McL. Decl. Ex. D. Genzyme also
informed investors that the Company did not expect the PDUFA extension to affect its
previously issued earnings guidance. See id.
The February 2009 Warning Letter And Complete Response Letter. The FDA issued a
warning letter (the “Warning Letter”) regarding the Allston Facility on February 27, 2009, citing
some of the same observations identified in the Form 483. See McL. Decl. Ex. E; Compl. ¶¶
112-13. Again, the Warning Letter did not make any reference to the detection or prevention of
viral contamination. See McL. Decl. Exs. A, E.
Also, on February 27, 2009, the FDA sent Genzyme a Complete Response Letter,
indicating that approval of the Lumizyme BLA would be withheld until discussions regarding
REMS and the post-approval clinical verification study, the two issues that had given rise to the

10

Case 1:09-cv-11267-GAO Document 63

PDUFA date extension in November 2008 (see above) were resolved, and until the Company
resolved the issues raised in the Warning Letter. See McL. Decl. Ex. F. Genzyme promptly
disclosed these letters on the first business day after receipt. See Compl. ¶¶ 274-75.
Continuing Efforts Re: Lumizyme Approval. Following its receipt of the Warning
Letter and the Complete Response Letter, Genzyme remained in regular communication with the
FDA regarding the Company’s progress, as it repeatedly disclosed to investors. See, e.g.,
Compl. ¶¶ 278, 294, 297. The FDA conducted additional inspections of the Allston Facility in
May 2009 and again in October to November 2009, issuing additional inspection observations on
November 13, 2009. See Compl. ¶¶ 163, 183.
2008 Geel And Allston Bioreactor Run Failures. In 2008, the Geel Facility was in the
“start up” phase of producing Myozyme at the 4000L scale. At that time, Myozyme produced at
the Geel Facility was not approved for sale in any market. See Compl. ¶ 51. Bioreactors at that
site were in the “process validation” stage, during which bioreactor process validation runs (“PV
runs”) are completed to confirm reliability and consistency of operation. In late September 2008,
one of the PV runs experienced an unexpected decline in cell productivity. See Compl. ¶ 95.
Rapid cell death during bioreactor runs is not uncommon in the manufacture of biologics, and
may be caused by bacteria, equipment failure, viruses or other causes. Genzyme immediately
initiated an investigation to determine the cause of the event. While that investigation was
ongoing, the Geel Facility resumed PV runs and successfully completed the process validation
stage of the regulatory approval process. After September 2008, no other incident of rapid cell
death was observed at the Geel Facility and Genzyme received EMEA approval for 4000L
Myozyme in late February 2009. Compl. ¶¶ 51, 111. This approval came several months earlier

11

Case 1:09-cv-11267-GAO Document 63

Filed 06/02/10 Page 20 of 60

than Genzyme expected, having advised the market earlier that month that such approval was
anticipated for April 2009. See McL. Decl. Ex. G.
In November 2008, Genzyme observed a decline in cell productivity in a bioreactor in
Allston used in the production of Myozyme at the 2000L scale for commercial sale in Europe,
where it had already been approved. Compl. ¶¶ 96, 256. Genzyme promptly initiated an
investigation, decontaminated the suite that houses the bioreactor, and quickly returned it to
service. Even in the months prior to the November 2008 event, Genzyme had cautioned the
market that Myozyme supplies would be constrained during early 2009.5 On January 13, 2009,
the Company announced that it had been working with a Myozyme stakeholder group (including
physicians and patient groups) on a Supply Management Plan to assist in managing the
availability of the therapy to patients during a period of tight supply. McL. Decl. Ex. J. On
January 16, 2009, the EMEA issued a press release addressing the Myozyme supply shortage and
Genzyme’s Supply Management Plan, specifically noting that “problems with the manufacture
of the medicine at some sites” as well as demand outpacing supply had contributed to the
shortages. McL. Decl. Ex. K. The EMEA press release also noted that Genzyme was
investigating the cause of the production problems at the sites. Id. Genzyme conducted its
investigation into the cause of these two events over a period of six months, and on June 16,
2009, announced it had determined that both the Geel and Allston events had been caused by a
rare virus.6

McL. Decl. Ex. H (Press Release and Form 8-K, Feb. 13, 2008) (“This [first quarter EPS] estimate also reflects the
U.S. introduction of Myozyme® (alglucosidase alfa), which has been constrained by limited product supply, as the

Company’s conclusion that all three were attributable to a rare virus, Vesivirus 2117. See
Compl. ¶¶ 139, 304. Genzyme also promptly took the precautionary action of shutting down the
Allston Facility for six-to-eight weeks and decontaminating the plant. Compl. ¶ 140. Genzyme

Facility for decontamination would have a material impact on the Company’s earnings. See

ARGUMENT
Plaintiffs looking to establish liability for violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 10b-5 must satisfy the following elements: (1) a false statement or omission of a
material fact; (2) made with scienter; (3) in connection with the purchase or sale of a security; (4)
upon which the plaintiff reasonably relied; (5) an economic loss; and (6) that the loss was caused
by the misrepresentation or omission. In re Boston Scientific Corp. Sec. Litig., 490 F. Supp. 2d
142, 153 (D. Mass. 2007) (citing Dura Pharms., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 341 (2005)).
Moreover, the PSLRA and controlling decisions of the Supreme Court and First Circuit impose
“heightened” pleading standards on securities plaintiffs. To avoid dismissal under Fed. R. Civ.
P. 12(b)(6) and 9(b), a plaintiff must allege “with particularity” the circumstances amounting to
fraud, including particularized facts supporting a “cogent and compelling” inference that the
defendants intentionally or recklessly acted to deceive investors. The fundamental pleading
principle that factual allegations must be “enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative
level,” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, such that the complaint establishes “‘a plausible entitlement to
relief,’” Vernet, 566 F.3d at 258 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 559), are elevated in the
securities context. The “who, what, where, and when” of a claim of misrepresentations or
omissions must be accompanied by “why” the circumstances can be chalked up to fraud.
I.

THE COMPLAINT SHOULD BE DISMISSED BECAUSE IT FAILS TO
SATISFY THE RIGOROUS PLEADING STANDARDS FOR SCIENTER
In Section III, below, we address the Complaint’s allegations on a statement-by-statement

or category-by-category basis, including why each individual statement does not support an
inference of reckless or intentional decision. But taken as a whole, the Complaint’s flaws merit
dismissal on its face. The first fatal flaw is its failure adequately to plead scienter. The
Complaint falls short of satisfying the Tellabs standard of supplying a “cogent and compelling”

14

Case 1:09-cv-11267-GAO Document 63

Filed 06/02/10 Page 23 of 60

inference that the defendants acted with the requisite state of mind to defraud investors. “A
[securities class action] complaint will survive [dismissal at the pleading stage] . . . only if a
reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any
opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.” Tellabs, 551 U.S. at 324.
To conjure up an inference that the defendants acted with scienter, the plaintiffs simply
juxtapose their version of events with the bald assertion that the defendants “knew” those “facts”
and “intentionally” failed to disclose them. According to the plaintiffs, the Company “was not
complying with cGMPs”; the Allston Facility was “severely overburdened” and created a
“serious risk” that the Company would be unable to supply the market; the Company had
“woefully deficient compliance practices”; and the “depth and pervasiveness” of the “woefully
deficient compliance practices” made the contamination of its products “inevitable.” See, e.g.,
Compl. ¶ 220(A)-(E). The pleading simply claims these “facts” as gospel and baldly attributes
their “non-disclosure” to an “intentional[ ] fail[ure] to inform the market . . . of material
information.” Id. at ¶ 323.
But why? Even if one accepts the plaintiffs’ allegations, the Complaint doesn’t begin to
hint at a motive for any officer of Genzyme to conceal anything from investors. The pleading
doesn’t describe a benefit that accrued to anyone, or even suggest that the Company was
somehow better off by leaving investors in the dark. The document does not point to earnings
that were manipulated, stock-based compensation that was obtained or kept, opportunities that
were generated or losses that were avoided as a result of any nondisclosure. The only thing the
Complaint alleges is that “facts” existed, the defendants “knew” them, and they were not
disclosed. But that allegation of “fraud” is tautological: the plaintiffs say that because “facts”
weren’t disclosed they were “intentionally” concealed. According to the plaintiffs, any omission

15

Case 1:09-cv-11267-GAO Document 63

Filed 06/02/10 Page 24 of 60

to publicize “facts” the defendants “knew” must have been purposefully concealed — even
though the pleading does not point to a single shred of evidence to make the connection.
But that is just faulty logic. The gap in the pleading that omits to connect the dots
between ostensible “knowledge” of “facts” and “intentional” deception of investors robs the
Complaint of any inference of reckless or deliberate nondisclosure. And where no inference of
either rash or premeditated behavior arises, surely a “cogent and compelling” inference does not
exist.
Logic aside, the limited pieces of real information the plaintiffs claim was “concealed” —
receipt of the 2008 Form 483, bioreactor failures, delays in approval dates set by the FDA —
were disclosed by Genzyme (or otherwise was made public) during the putative class period.
Contrary to the impression the plaintiffs’ generalized allegations strive to create, Genzyme’s
actions and pronouncements paint a picture of steady disclosure as events warranted — a picture
that stands in direct contrast to the story served up in the Complaint. So, for example:


The Form 483 reflecting observations made by the FDA in mid-October 2008 was
disclosed to investors on March 2, 2009, when Genzyme announced that it had received a
Warning Letter from the FDA addressing some of those observations.



On November 17, 2008, the Company disclosed that it received, just days before, a notice
from the FDA stating that the PDUFA date for its Lumizyme BLA would be delayed
until the end of February 2009.



On January 13, 2009, the Company disclosed that due to shortages in the supply of
Myozyme, it had been working with stakeholder groups (physicians and patients) on a
plan to manage supplies of the treatment.



On January 16, 2009, the EMEA issued a press release noting that Genzyme had
experienced manufacturing problems that had contributed to Myozyme supply shortages,
and that Genzyme was investigating the cause of those events.



On June 16, 2009, the Company disclosed that a manufacturing run in one of the 2000L
bioreactors in use at its Allston plant had been found, just days before, to have been
contaminated by a virus.
The fact that much of the information that Genzyme supposedly “concealed” was in fact

made public throughout the course of the putative class period eviscerates any inference that the

16

Case 1:09-cv-11267-GAO Document 63

Filed 06/02/10 Page 25 of 60

defendants deliberately sought to keep that information from the public for more than two-years.7
Instead, it raises a contrary, non-fraudulent inference which, in the language of Tellabs, is plainly
more “compelling” than any inference the plaintiffs could hope to raise. Courts frequently find
that patterns of repeated disclosure during a putative class period undermine the inference of
fraudulent intent urged by securities class action plaintiffs. See Horizon Asset Mgmt., Inc. v.
H&R Block, Inc., 580 F.3d 755, 763-64 (8th Cir. 2009) (citing company’s disclosures and
finding that “[t]hese statements do not support an inference that [defendant’s officers] intended
to deceive the public or acted with severe recklessness. Rather, they portray managers who
disclosed known accounting problems and warned that work on their internal controls was
continuing.”); Iron Workers Local No. 25 Pension Fund v. Oshkosh Corp., 08-CV-797, 2010
WL 1287058, at *21 (E.D. Wis. Mar. 30, 2010) (“[A]ny inference of an intent to deceive is
further undermined by the disclosures the company actually made.”).8
In addition to the stream of public disclosures during the putative class period, Genzyme
also engaged in consistent communications with its primary regulators at the FDA and EMEA.
The plaintiffs themselves allege that their claims are based in part on Genzyme’s correspondence
with the FDA, which the plaintiffs purportedly obtained via requests made pursuant to the
Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”). See Compl. ¶¶ 2, 60, 64. Genzyme routinely
communicated with regulators regarding the manufacturing problems it had experienced at Geel
and Allston, McL. Decl. Ex. K (EMEA Press Release, Jan. 16, 2009); the shortage of Myozyme
and Genzyme’s plans for “safeguarding Myozyme supply for infants and children,” McL. Decl.
7

In order to minimize the obvious importance of these disclosures, the plaintiffs grudgingly acknowledge, as they
must, that the defendants “made partial disclosures of the existence of some of these serious problems during the
latter part of the Class Period . . . .” Compl. ¶ 89.

See also In re The First Marblehead Corp. Sec. Litig., 639 F. Supp. 2d 145, 163 (D. Mass. 2009) (holding that
defendant’s series of disclosures, in part, negated strong inference of scienter); Gaines v. Guidant Corp., No. 03CV-892, 2004 WL 2538374, at *13-14 (S.D. Ind. Nov. 8, 2004) (same); In re Brightpoint, Inc. Sec. Litig., No. IP99-0870, 2001 WL 395752, at *17 (S.D. Ind. Mar. 29, 2001) (same).

Ex. J (Press Release, Jan. 13, 2009); and Genzyme’s progress on addressing the FDA’s Form
483 observations. McL. Decl. Ex. S (Press Release, Mar. 2, 2009, noting that Genzyme
submitted responses on Oct. 31, 2008 and Feb. 23, 2009). The Company’s regulatory
disclosures also confirm that Genzyme — far from covering up information relating to the
various issues raised in the Complaint — was pushing information out. This, too, undermines
any inference that the defendants sought to “hide” information with fraudulent intent. After all,
once in the hands of regulators, the information was available as appropriate under FOIA to
requesting members of the public; it was not confidential information held by Genzyme alone.9
It is hard to believe that Genzyme would at once disclose information to regulators, and
yet nonetheless set out on a deliberate plan to conceal the same information from the public.
And, in fact, Genzyme’s disclosures to regulators did lead to public disclosure of relevant
information by those regulators. For example, the Complaint insists that the public was unaware
of problems with two separate bioreactor runs at the Geel and Allston facilities in 2008. But the
EMEA did disclose information in a press release based on information provided by Genzyme
concerning bioreactor run failures in Allston and Geel. See McL. Decl. Ex. K (citing
manufacturing problems at Genzyme facilities as contributing causes to potential Myozyme
supply shortages and noting Genzyme’s investigation).
Just as Genzyme’s pattern of public disclosures negates any inference of scienter, the
regulatory disclosures throughout the putative class period also undermine an inference of
9

FDA regulations provide for the public disclosure of Form 483s via FOIA request. See 21 C.F.R. §20.101(a)
(2009) (“All Food and Drug Administration records relating to administrative enforcement action disclosed to any
member of the public, including the person who is the subject of such action, are available for public disclosure at
the time such disclosure is first made. Such records include correspondence with companies following factory
inspection, recall or detention requests, notice of refusal of admission of an imported product, regulatory letters,
information letters, Forms FD-483 and FD-2275 furnished to companies after factory inspection, and similar
records.”) (emphasis added); see also 21 C.F.R. §20.103(a) (2009) (“All correspondence to and from members of
the public . . . is available for public disclosure.”); 21 C.F.R. § 20.103(b) (2009) (“Any such correspondence is
available for public disclosure at the time that it is sent or received by the Food and Drug Administration . . . .”).

scienter-based fraud. The Complaint purports to describe a two-year cover-up of facts by
Genzyme, but nowhere explains why — if the Company intended to keep these matters secret —
it made the disclosures it did make, when it did. It is not enough for the plaintiffs to allege that
the defendants “must” have known and “must” have intended to conceal. Instead, they must
raise a “cogent and compelling” or “strong” inference that the defendants acted with the requisite
scienter to engage in a two-year fraud. Under Tellabs, the allegations fail entirely to raise a
strong or compelling inference that Genzyme acted with scienter to conceal the information
described in the Complaint; moreover, the steady pace of affirmative disclosure by Genzyme —
both to the public and to regulators — raises a competing counter-inference that Genzyme sought
to comply with its obligations at all times. This, alone, justifies dismissal of the Complaint.
II.

THE COMPLAINT SHOULD BE DISMISSED BECAUSE THE INFORMATION
ALLEGED TO HAVE BEEN “CONCEALED” BY GENZYME IS IMMATERIAL
AS A MATTER OF LAW AND GENZYME HAD NO DUTY TO DISCLOSE IT
A second ground for dismissal stems from the lack of a duty to make the disclosures the

plaintiffs insist Genzyme should have made. While the Complaint pegs various categories of
“omitted” information to particular statements during the class period — arguing that all of the
statements were rendered false or misleading because of the omissions — at bottom the
plaintiffs’ basic claim is that the defendants failed to make disclosures concerning alleged
conditions relating to Genzyme’s manufacturing operations. Most centrally, the plaintiffs
complain that the Company did not disclose its receipt of the October 2008 Form 483 (or the
contents of that Form 483) until March 2009; the Company did not disclose its alleged failure to
comply with cGMPs; and the Company did not disclose that two bioreactor runs failed in 2008.
The reason the plaintiffs seek to pin these alleged “omissions” to affirmative statements is
obvious: under the case law, these alleged “facts” are not material and there is no duty to disclose
them otherwise.

Genzyme Did Not Have A Duty to Disclose Its Receipt of Form 483
“Inspectional Observations” from the FDA

Genzyme received from the FDA a Form 483 in October 2008 containing a number of
observations made by FDA inspectors regarding the Allston Facility. The Company did not
disclose either the receipt of the form or the specific observations it contained until March 2,
2009, when the Company disclosed that it had received a Warning Letter from the FDA as a
follow-up to some of the prior observations. The fact that Genzyme did not disclose the Form
483 observations between October 2008 and March 2009 is perhaps the most frequently repeated
allegation in the Complaint.10 But courts have squarely rejected the claim that companies are
required to disclose their receipt of Form 483 observations from the FDA.
Form 483s prominently feature prefatory language stating that they contain only
“inspectional observations” that “do not represent a final FDA determination regarding [the
company’s] compliance.” Courts have cited this language, along with similar language in the
agency’s published guidelines in holding non-actionable the non-disclosure of Form 483s. See
Pub. Pension Fund Group v. KV Pharm., No. 4:08-CV-1859, 2010 WL 681443, at *10 (E.D.
Mo. Feb. 22, 2010) (noting that “the FDA explicitly states on its website that a Form 483 does
not represent the FDA’s final determination of a company’s compliance”).11 Just like the
plaintiffs here, the KV Pharm. plaintiffs contended that the defendant company had a duty to
disclose numerous Form 483s because the forms purportedly confirmed the company’s noncompliance with cGMPs. Compare id. at *10, with Compl. ¶ 259(A)-(B). The district court
disagreed and dismissed the claims, holding that “the Form 483s issued to KV only contained

10

See Compl. ¶¶ 11, 12, 100, 103, 105-107, 109, 114, 116, 120, 250, 252, 255, 258, 259, 269.

11

Notably, the plaintiffs in the KV Pharm. case pointed to a series of specific, affirmative statements by the
defendant company that “[w]e are currently in material compliance with cGMP.” Id. at *1-4, 10. No such
affirmative statement is at issue here.

observations — not ‘a list of cGMP violations’ as alleged by lead plaintiffs.” KV Pharm., 2010
WL 681443 at *10.
The Second Circuit also affirmed the dismissal of a Section 10(b) claim premised on the
defendant’s failure to disclose the receipt of FDA inspection observations. See Acito v. IMCERA
Group, Inc., 47 F.3d 47 (2d. Cir. 1995). Although the Acito plaintiffs alleged that the results of
the FDA’s inspections of the defendant’s facilities “constituted material information and should
have been disclosed to the investing public,” both the trial and appellate courts disagreed, citing
the interim nature of the FDA’s observations and noting that “[i]t would be unduly burdensome
and impractical to publicly disseminate the results of every inspection of every plant.” Id. at 5253.
The Acito court also rejected very nearly the same allegation as one the plaintiffs offer
here: that the receipt of the Form 483 made it inevitable that the FDA would not approve the
Company’s pending application relating to a new product. Instead, the Second Circuit held that
an interim FDA inspection report does not support an inference that “it was a foregone
conclusion” at the time of the report that approval of the subject drug would be denied. Id. at 53.
The same reasoning is fatal to the plaintiffs’ parallel claim that Genzyme somehow knew that its
Lumizyme BLA would not be approved once it had received Form 483 observations.
Several courts, including courts in this District, have gone a step further, holding that a
company’s failure to disclose an FDA warning letter — a letter that conveys “the Agency’s
position on a matter” and typically follows the receipt of a Form 483 when issues are not
resolved to the FDA’s satisfaction — also is not actionable under Section 10(b), because even a
warning letter is merely “informal and advisory.” See Boston Scientific, 490 F. Supp. 2d at 16061 & n.113, rev’d on other grounds, Miss. Pub. Employees Retirement Sys. v. Boston Scientific

Corp., 523 F.3d 75, 86 (1st Cir. 2008).12 In Boston Scientific, the plaintiff cited FDA “warning
letters [that] outlined significant deficiencies or regulatory problems that inspectors discovered at
BSC plants,” and alleged that Boston Scientific’s failure to disclose the letters was materially
misleading to investors. Id. at 161. The district court disagreed, granting the motion to dismiss
in light of the “court’s view that the FDA letters were not material and that [the company] had no
affirmative duty to disclose them.” Id. at 161 & n.113; Anderson v. Abbott Labs., 140 F. Supp.
2d 894, 902 (N.D. Ill. 2001) (granting motion to dismiss and observing that “[t]here is nothing
magical about the warning letter. Although the language sounds ominous, it really is rather
boilerplate.”), aff’d sub nom. Gallagher v. Abbott Labs., 269 F.3d 806 (7th Cir. 2001). Here, the
plaintiffs’ allegations concern the non-disclosure (for a period of months) of an “observational”
Form 483; it is clear that such information is not material as a matter of law, and that Genzyme
had no duty to disclose it.
Addressing nearly identical claims relating to Form 483 disclosure, the KV Pharm. court
identified a second reason why non-disclosure of a Form 483 is not actionable — because any
Form 483 is contained in FDA files and is publicly available via FOIA request. In dismissing an
allegation that the defendant corporation misled investors by failing to disclose the receipt of
eight Form 483s, the KV Pharm. court cited (among the reasons) the fact that the Form 483s
were publicly available and noted that “‘the securities laws require disclosure of information that
is not otherwise in the public domain.’” Id. at *14 (quoting Sailors v. N. States Power Co., 4
F.3d 610, 613 (8th Cir. 1993)) (emphasis in original). Thus, for the additional reason that the
Form 483s were “readily accessible to the public by submitting a request to the FDA” pursuant

The Boston Scientific court cited the FDA’s Regulatory Procedures Manual on Warning Letters: “A Warning
Letter is informal and advisory. It communicates the Agency’s position on a matter, but it does not commit FDA to
taking enforcement action.” http://www.fda.gov/downloads/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/RegulatoryProcedures

to FOIA, the court held that “[defendants] were under no duty to disclose these documents.” KV
Pharm., 2010 WL 681443 at *14. The same logic applies here.
B.

Genzyme Did Not Have A Duty to Disclose Purported “Non-Compliance”
With cGMPs

Plaintiffs insist that Genzyme was required — even prior to its receipt of the FDA Form
483 observations — to disclose that it “was not complying with cGMP at the Allston plant.” But
the only particularized allegation supporting the alleged deficiencies set forth in the Complaint
arises from the Form 483 observations made in October 2008. As noted above, courts have
rejected claims that inspectional observations by the FDA by themselves establish violations of
cGMP standards. See Section II. A., supra.
C.

Genzyme Did Not Have A Duty to Disclose Purported Manufacturing
Difficulties

A third central thrust of the plaintiffs’ claims is that Genzyme was required to disclose
manufacturing difficulties or alleged “compliance failures” at the Allston Facility.13 These range
from the failure of two bioreactor runs in 2008 to a litany of “deficiencies” (lifted from FDA
observations made in the 2008 Form 483), such as “failure to properly maintain equipment,”
“overloaded facility,” “unsterile airflow system,” and “lack of adequate training and record
keeping.” See Compl. ¶ 6.14 But courts have refused to impose a duty on companies to disclose
operational or manufacturing setbacks. See Minneapolis Firefighters’ Relief Ass’n v. MEMC
Elec. Materials, Inc., No. 4:08-CV-1411, 2010 WL 889864, at *5-6 (E.D. Mo. Mar. 8, 2010) (no
duty to disclose manufacturing disruptions at two facilities); In re Ford Motor Co. Sec. Litig.,
13

See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 250, 251, 259(A)-(B), 269, 287(A), 310(A).

14

Plaintiffs’ five “confidential witnesses” add little if anything to what the Complaint has already lifted from the
Form 483. See Compl. ¶¶ 63 (2007 contamination at Allston); 66 (chromatography columns); 78, 102 (hiring
practices); 82 (Framingham facility); 82 (Framingham testing of raw materials). None of the alleged deficiencies
they report amounts to anything Genzyme was required to disclose. Furthermore, one confidential witnesses left
Genzyme in 2004 (¶ 66) and another in 2007 (¶ 63), before the class period even began, and two others left
Genzyme in 2008 and are not alleged to have worked at Allston (¶ 82).

Supp. 2d 446, 459 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (no obligation to disclose software product or customer

1984) (no duty to disclose risks and defects at chemical plant, despite the fact that they later
resulted in industrial accident). Instead, courts have recognized that requiring the disclosure of
each manufacturing difficulty or condition “would constitute an overly expansive reading of the
federal securities laws, and might encourage corporations to disclose trivial information not
necessary for informed decision making.” Union Carbide, 648 F. Supp. at 1328.
Plaintiffs’ contention that the difficulties confronted by the Company were the result of
undisclosed “woefully inadequate compliance practices” or a list of “extraordinary, serious and
undisclosed problems that plagued Genzyme and its flagship Allston Facility” smack of an effort
to manufacture claims after-the-fact from allegations of poor management — allegations courts
have long held are not actionable under the federal securities laws. See, e.g., Santa Fe Indus.,
430 U.S. at 479 (“We thus adhere to the position that ‘Congress by § 10(b) did not seek to
regulate transactions which constitute no more than internal corporate mismanagement.’”)
(quoting Superintendent of Ins. v. Bankers Life & Cas. Co., 404 U.S. 6, 12 (1971)).15 The result
should be no different here.

15

Courts have relied on Santa Fe in dismissing federal securities laws claims which “sound[] more in [allegations
of] possible corporate mismanagement, viewed retrospectively, than in fraud.” Union Carbide, 648 F. Supp. at
1328; see also First Marblehead, 639 F. Supp. 2d at 160-61 (relying on Santa Fe in dismissing allegations of
inadequate internal controls and mismanagement); Akerman v. Bankworcester Corp., 751 F. Supp. 11, 12-13 (D.

THE COMPLAINT SHOULD BE DISMISSED BECAUSE THE STATEMENTS
CITED IN THE COMPLAINT ARE NOT ACTIONABLE
As demonstrated above, the alleged information the plaintiffs insist Genzyme

“concealed” during the class period is not information Genzyme had a duty to disclose. This fact
alone justifies dismissal of the Complaint. To avoid this result, the plaintiffs hope to establish
that Genzyme had a duty to disclose allegedly “concealed” information because of affirmative
statements the Company did make during the class period, statements the plaintiffs allege were
rendered “false and misleading” because of the “concealed” information.
A.

The Complaint Fails to Allege Any Actionable Misstatement or Omission
Regarding Genzyme’s Anticipation of FDA Approval of the Lumizyme BLA

About half of the statements alleged to be “false or misleading” consist of substantially
similar public statements by Genzyme or its officers regarding the Company’s expectations of
approval of the Lumizyme BLA, and the timing for that approval.16 The plaintiffs assert that the
identified statements were false or misleading because of a variety of alleged “facts” —
including that the Allston Facility was not in compliance with cGMPs and that unspecified
“stress” on that plant meant that Genzyme would ultimately not be able to satisfy FDA
requirements for Lumizyme approval. See Compl. ¶¶ 220, 227, 242-43. These claims fail to
state an actionable claim under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act for several independent
reasons, each of which justifies dismissal. First, the plaintiffs themselves acknowledge in the
Complaint that “there is no assurance that the FDA will make a determination by any given
target PDUFA date, and certainly no assurance that the FDA will actually approve (rather than
reject) the new product application by that date.” Compl. ¶ 93. Second, the statements fail to

25

Case 1:09-cv-11267-GAO Document 63

satisfy the exacting standards for pleading scienter. Third, the statements are forward-looking
and shielded by the PSLRA’s “safe harbor” and the common law “bespeaks caution” doctrine.
1.

Plaintiffs Cannot Have Reasonably Relied on Statements Concerning the
Possible Timing of FDA’s Approval of Lumizyme

Plaintiffs complain that Genzyme made repeated statements concerning the expected
timing of FDA approval of the Lumizyme application. During the putative class period, when
the Company described the anticipated timing of FDA action on Lumizyme, it relied upon the
so-called PDUFA date — the target date of six months from the date of filing, by which the
agency is expected to act on a drug application. The plaintiffs contend that Genzyme’s
statements regarding the FDA’s timing on Lumizyme were false throughout the putative class
period, because the FDA failed to approve the Lumizyme BLA on the Company’s expected
schedule.
But the plaintiffs cannot establish the necessary element of “reasonable reliance” in
connection with this central aspect of their claim. The FDA’s setting of a PDUFA date is not a
guarantee that the agency will act on or before that date; rather, it expresses a goal or target,
nothing more, and can be extended.17 This is widely understood.18 Indeed the plaintiffs
themselves expressly acknowledge that “there is no assurance that the FDA will make a
determination by any given target PDUFA date, and certainly no assurance that the FDA will
actually approve (rather than reject) the new product application by that date.” Compl. ¶ 93.

In this way, the plaintiffs’ own allegations admit that investors knew there could be “no
assurance” of FDA action, or the timeframe for it, and thus confirm that they could not have
reasonably relied on any anticipatory statement by Genzyme on that subject. See Garvey v.
Arkoosh, 354 F. Supp. 2d 73, 82 n.12 (D. Mass. 2005) (dismissing fraud-on-the-market claims
where information available to the market prevented reasonable reliance on allegedly misleading
statements); see also Rodriguez-Ortiz v. Margo Caribe, Inc., 490 F.3d 92, 96 (1st Cir. 2007)
(citing reasonable reliance as an essential element of a Section 10(b) claim). Because the
Complaint itself concedes that the PDUFA date supplied by the FDA cannot be relied upon as a
guarantee of agency action by a certain date, there can be no reasonable reliance in connection
with Genzyme’s statements relating to the timing of FDA approval of the Lumizyme BLA.
2.

Plaintiffs’ Allegations Fall Short of the Requirements For Pleading
Scienter

As argued above, see supra Section I, the Complaint fails to supply a strong inference of
scienter, because the pattern of public and regulatory disclosures by Genzyme during the period
fatally undermines any inference of fraudulent intent, let alone one that is sufficiently “cogent
and compelling” to meet the Tellabs test. This is especially true of the many class period
statements attributed to the defendants concerning anticipated Lumizyme approval and its timing
— statements which comprise the great bulk of the purported “misstatements.” In this Section,
we address the Complaint’s failure to allege scienter specifically with regard to these statements.
“The PSLRA requires that the plaintiffs’ complaint, ‘with respect to each act or omission
. . . , state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with
the required state of mind.’” N.J. Carpenters Pension & Annuity Funds v. Biogen IDEC, Inc.,
537 F.3d 35, 44 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(2)) (affirming dismissal of
securities fraud claim where plaintiffs failed adequately to allege scienter). The required state of

27

Case 1:09-cv-11267-GAO Document 63

Filed 06/02/10 Page 36 of 60

mind for a securities fraud claim is “‘a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or
defraud.’” Id. (quoting Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 193 n.12 (1976)). As noted,
the Supreme Court has held that the PSLRA’s “strong inference” of scienter requires something
“more than merely plausible or reasonable — it must be cogent and at least as compelling as any
opposing inference of non-fraudulent intent.” Tellabs, 551 U.S. at 314.
Pre-Form 483 Statements. The Complaint cites a number of statements concerning FDA
approval of Lumizyme made during the period from October 24, 2007 — the start of the putative
class period — to October 10, 2008, the date Genzyme received the Form 483. The Complaint
asserts that statements of anticipation as to Lumizyme approval during this period were false
because the defendants purportedly “knew” that approval would not be granted due to the
Allston Facility “not complying with cGMP,” “woefully deficient compliance practices,” and
other “stress” placed on the plant. See Compl. ¶ 220. But nowhere does the Complaint allege
with particularity how the defendants purportedly knew this information during the relevant
period; there is only the bald assertion that they did. As a result, there simply is no basis upon
which to draw an inference of scienter in connection with these statements, let alone the “strong
inference” required by the PSLRA and Tellabs. See Rodriguez-Ortiz, 490 F.3d at 96 (“[A]s to
scienter, not any inference will do: the ultimate inference of scienter must be a strong one.”).19
Lacking specific facts, the plaintiffs instead resort to conclusory allegations of conditions
that purportedly render the statements false: supposed “woefully deficient compliance
practices,” “rampant [cGMP] violations,” and “serious deficiencies at the Allston plant.” Compl.
¶¶ 57, 220, 251. But these generalized accusations — devoid of any particularized factual
support — simply do not suffice to support a “strong inference” that the defendants knew at any
19

Moreover, because statements relating to expected Lumizyme approval are forward-looking, as explained in more
detail below, the PSLRA requires the plaintiffs to plead facts giving rise to a strong inference of actual knowledge,
not merely constructive knowledge. See Praecis, 2007 WL 951695 at *5. This the Complaint fails entirely to do.

28

Case 1:09-cv-11267-GAO Document 63

relevant time that the Allston Facility was “violating” cGMPs or that there would be a delay to
the Lumizyme BLA approval process.20 See KV Pharm., 2010 WL 681443 at *10 (granting
motion to dismiss Section 10(b) claim where plaintiffs pled no specific facts to show the
defendant’s cGMP non-compliance).
Statements between Receipt of Form 483 and Complete Response Letter. Plaintiffs also
allege that after the Company received the FDA’s Form 483 observations in October 2008, its
statements on Lumizyme timing and approval continued to be misleading, because the Form 483
allegedly informed Genzyme that Lumizyme approval would be delayed beyond the November
2008 PDUFA date and/or that the BLA would not be approved at all. See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 250,
252, 255, 259, 264. Again, plaintiffs allege nothing more by way of particularized fact. The
Complaint merely leaps to the conclusion that as a result of the October Form 483, Genzyme
“knew” that the Lumizyme BLA PDUFA date would be extended from November 2008 to
February 2009 — a “fact” the plaintiffs insist was required to be disclosed. Compl. ¶¶ 335, 336.
This conclusion-alleged-as-fact is absurd. The Form 483 contains no information
whatever regarding a change in the PDUFA date. See McL. Decl. Ex. A. As the plaintiffs
acknowledge, Genzyme did announce on November 17, 2008 — just days after receiving
notification from the FDA — that the PDUFA date had been extended. Compl. ¶ 261. And the
plaintiffs fail to state any basis upon which Genzyme “knew”, prior to receiving the FDA’s
notification, that the PDUFA date would be extended. The PSLRA requires more than
conclusory assertions that a defendant “knew” a fact at an earlier time; it requires particularized
allegations showing who knew information and when to support the claim that information was
actually withheld with scienter. N.J. Carpenters, 537 F.3d at 44 (“‘Securities actions raise
20

Plaintiffs also make no attempt at all to allege any facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter that the
defendants had actual knowledge at this time that unspecified “stress” on the Allston Facility would later have an
impact on the Lumizyme BLA.

29

Case 1:09-cv-11267-GAO Document 63

questions of what corporate managers knew and when they knew it.’” (quoting Boston Scientific,
523 F.3d at 86) (emphasis in original). The Complaint here fails entirely on that basis.
Indeed, the plaintiffs simply assume that Genzyme was in a position to know that the
cGMP observations and other issues cited in the Form 483 could have any impact on the timing
of Lumizyme approval. In fact, the Form 483 observations were not directed at issues related to
bioreactors, bioreactor size, or even the contamination risks that eventuated. They instead dealt
primarily with “fill and finish” issues that were “downstream” from the bioreactor processes.
The plaintiffs misleadingly take observations related to one small aspect of the overall
manufacturing process, and escalate them into conclusions about other unrelated aspects of the
manufacturing process. That is not logical pleading; it is deceptive pleading instead.
In fact, the defendants had every reason to expect that FDA approval of the Lumizyme
BLA would be forthcoming. In late October, Genzyme secured a key vote in support of the
clinical effectiveness of Lumizyme from the FDA Advisory Committee. See McL. Decl. Ex. C.
Further, FDA guidance states that FDA staff is responsible for communicating to applicants “any
significant changes in the review timeline” which might be occasioned by “problems identified
during facilities inspections.”21 The Complaint fails to allege that the FDA communicated with
Genzyme about any purported impact that issuance of the Form 483 would have on the timing of
the Lumizyme application review. With no guidance from the FDA that the PDUFA date would
be impacted by the inspection process or the Form 483 observations, Genzyme reasonably
believed that the PDUFA date was not impacted by those factors. See Fort Worth Employers’
Retirement Fund v. Biovail Corp., 615 F. Supp. 2d 218, 228 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (“There is not a
single allegation in the Amended Complaint that the FDA ever explicitly warned defendants that

Moreover, as the plaintiffs themselves explicitly acknowledge, the FDA’s European
regulatory counterpart — the EMEA — had already approved Myozyme at the 2000L scale, and
had inspected the Allston Facility in 2008 (and certified the plant for cGMP compliance in July
2008). See Compl. ¶ 48 (“Genzyme was able to obtain quick approval from European authorities
to sell Lumizyme [manufactured at the Allston Facility] in Europe.”). This fact alone
demonstrates that it was reasonable for the defendants to believe in the prospects for Lumizyme
approval.22 See In re AstraZeneca Sec. Litig., 559 F. Supp. 2d 453, 471 (S.D.N.Y. 2008)
(scienter pleading insufficient as to ultimate FDA rejection of drug application because “it [was]
not unreasonable for defendants to believe in their product” in light of its approval in Europe).
Having plainly failed to plead any specific factual basis upon which the defendants can
be shown to have acted with scienter, the plaintiffs here opt for a puzzle-pleading structure that
diverts attention from the lack of specific allegations of knowledge. This pattern — alleged
misstatements matched only with conclusory omitted “facts” unsupported by specific allegations
of particularized information known to the defendants at the time the statements were made —
recurs throughout the Complaint. So, for example, the plaintiffs contend that the defendants
knew after receiving the October 2008 Form 483 that Lumizyme approval would be delayed or
would not occur because of a myriad of supposed “barriers” to approval, including cGMP noncompliance and the risk that such “violations” would lead to contamination at Genzyme’s
22

In fact, as Genzyme publicly disclosed, it had received approval for Myozyme manufactured at the 2000L scale in
approximately 40 countries. McL. Decl. Ex. T at 3 (Tr. of Conf. Call, Apr. 21, 2008).

facilities. See Compl. ¶ 259. But this is all supposition. As shown above, the receipt of a Form
483 simply does not establish cGMP non-compliance. See Section II. A., supra.
Moreover, the Complaint nowhere alleges — with particularity or otherwise — a causal
link between cGMP issues and the viral contamination Genzyme experienced at its facilities.
The Complaint merely contends in the broadest terms that the issues cited in the October 2008
Form 483 have some bearing on the viral contamination that occurred at the Geel and Allston
Facilities in late 2008.23 But a review of the Form 483 shows that its content relates largely to
“fill and finish” manufacturing processes “downstream” of the bioreactors where the
contamination occurred; nothing in the Form 483 has anything to do with deficiencies at Allston
in detecting or preventing viral contaminations. See McL. Decl. Ex. A. The plaintiffs have not
— and cannot — allege any relationship between the observations raised in the Form 483
(which, as noted above, did not establish cGMP “violations” in any event) and the contamination
events suffered at the Geel and Allston Facilities. See also Sections II. A., C., infra. As there is
simply no relationship between the contaminations, which occurred in bioreactors, and the Form
483 observations, relating to different aspects of the manufacturing process, the plaintiffs have
not pled sufficient facts to support their fanciful theory that Genzyme somehow “knew” that the
Form 483 observations raised a risk that the Company would also experience bioreactor failures.
Post-Complete Response Letter Statements. Addressing the period after February 28,
2009, when Genzyme received the Complete Response Letter and Warning Letter from FDA, the
plaintiffs’ allegations continue in the same form. The Complaint contends, for example, that
statements regarding Lumizyme approval during this period were materially misleading because
the defendants purportedly knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that the concerns raised by
23

See Compl. ¶ 259 (“Defendants failed to disclose . . . the materially heightened risk that those [cGMP] violations
would lead to contamination or adulterated products at Allston, as had recently occurred (but not been disclosed) at
Geel.”).

32

Case 1:09-cv-11267-GAO Document 63

the FDA in the Warning Letter “were ongoing and would not be resolved” by Genzyme’s
proposed corrective measures nor within the “short time frame” Genzyme described. Compl. ¶
287. As the Complaint concedes, Genzyme promptly disclosed the receipt of both letters.
Compl. ¶ 114. The plaintiffs nonetheless advance the loosely drawn allegation that, following
the Warning Letter, Genzyme somehow came to know that the problems cited by the FDA would
take a longer time to address and that Genzyme’s proposed corrective measures would ultimately
not work (or would not work within the anticipated time frame).
Again, all of this is supposition. The Complaint simply does not identify facts with any
particularity to support an inference — let alone the required strong inference — that the
defendants’ statements concerning Lumizyme approval were made with knowledge that the BLA
would not be approved. For example, when the plaintiffs assert that Genzyme knew (but failed
to disclose) that the problems in Allston “would not be corrected,” see Compl. ¶ 287(A), on its
face the allegation is premised on hindsight. See id. (“Moreover, as the FDA would later
conclude, Genzyme had failed even to implement its own [corrective action] plans . . . .”)
(emphasis added).24 Allegations based on hindsight are plainly insufficient to withstand a
motion to dismiss. See First Marblehead, 639 F. Supp. 2d at 160 (“[The] allegations amount to
fraud by hindsight, essentially inferring earlier knowledge based only on the situation that later
came to pass, which the First Circuit has consistently rejected.”) (internal quotations omitted);
see also In re Discovery Labs. Sec. Litig., No. 06-1820, 2007 WL 789432, at *5 (E.D. Pa. Mar.
15, 2007) (“The fact that, more than two years later Discovery has not been able to remedy the
problems [cited in the Form 483] . . . does not make the earlier statements false or misleading.”).
24

While not essential to resolution of this motion, the notion that Genzyme did not take any corrective action is
patently false, a fact that the plaintiffs know from their review of FDA correspondence. See, e.g., McL. Decl. Ex. B
(Letter to FDA, Oct. 31, 2008) (outlining Genzyme’s plan to respond to Form 483 observations); Ex. U (Letter to
FDA, Feb. 23, 2009) (follow-up letter to FDA outlining progress); Ex. V at 21 (Form 10-K for 2008, Mar. 2, 2009)
(outlining plan and timeline for corrective action and progress toward completion).

This Court considered conceptually similar scienter allegations in In re Praecis Pharms.
Inc., Sec. Litig., 2007 WL 951695. In that action, the plaintiffs contended that the defendant’s
optimistic statements regarding the market for its new product were materially misleading
because the defendant purportedly knew that the sales goals it set were unlikely to be achieved
and that the pricing structure for the product would ultimately prevent the company from
attaining those sales goals. Id. at *11-12. In dismissing the Section 10(b) claim for failure to
plead scienter, the Court stated:
[I]t is not reasonable to think that the defendants intentionally
launched the Company’s flagship product with what they
recognized was a flawed pricing structure, as if they were more
interested in fooling the stock market in the short term than
succeeding in the product market in the long run.
Id. at *12. The same reasoning applies with equal force here, where the plaintiffs urge the
unreasonable inference that Genzyme somehow (nowhere explained) knew that the Lumizyme
BLA was doomed and that the product would never make it to market, yet continued to advise
investors that approval was expected imminently. As in Praecis, it would be unreasonable to
think that Genzyme was more interested in “fooling the stock market in the short term” than in
seeing Lumizyme approved and released to the market.25 This is especially so given that
Genzyme did disclose information on the FDA’s timing and decisions throughout the period.
Other cases echo this Court’s approach in Praecis, where plaintiffs contended that a
company’s prospective statements of positive prospects for a new drug were false or misleading
under Section 10(b). For example, in AstraZeneca, the plaintiffs alleged that statements
regarding the company’s anticipation of FDA approval of Exanta, a drug in late-stage clinical

25

Indeed, while securities fraud plaintiffs often cite insider stock sales as a means of establishing an inference of
scienter, the plaintiffs advance no such allegations here. The implausibility of the scienter inference the plaintiffs
urge is nowhere more evident than in the pervasive lack of any explanation of why the defendants would have
engaged in the supposed elaborate deception.

trials, were materially misleading because the company purportedly “knew” when it made the
statements that approval was unlikely. 559 F. Supp. 2d at 456. The district court noted that:
[I]f the management of the company releases positive reports about
the drug to the public along the way which the management
honestly believes to be true, and where there is no reckless
disregard for truth, then that is not securities fraud, even though at
a later point some event occurs which prevents the marketing of
the drug or makes it necessary to take the drug off the market.
Id. at 470-71 (dismissing for failure adequately to allege scienter where the complaint contained
“nothing whatever to indicate that the statements made [about Exanta’s prospects for FDA
approval] did not reflect the honest belief” of management). The same result should obtain here;
where the Complaint contains “nothing whatever” to indicate that “there was a consensus of the
management” that the issues identified by the FDA would take longer to resolve than Genzyme
then anticipated or that the Lumizyme BLA was “unlikely to be approved.” Id.

The PSLRA Safe Harbor and the Common Law Bespeaks Caution
Doctrine Preclude Liability

Finally, all of the alleged misstatements relating to Lumizyme approval are forwardlooking and fall within the PSLRA’s safe harbor (and also are subject to the protections afforded
by the safe-harbor’s common law predecessor, the “bespeaks caution” doctrine). For this
additional reason, they are not actionable under Section 10(b). See 15 U.S.C. § 78u-5 (2010).
The PSLRA safe harbor extends immunity from securities fraud claims to certain types of
statements that “speak predictively of the future.” In re Stone & Webster, Inc., Sec. Litig., 414
F.3d 187, 195 (1st Cir. 2005); see also 15 U.S.C. § 78u-5(i)(1) (2010) (defining “forwardlooking statement”). Such statements are protected where: (1) the forward-looking statement is
identified as such and is “accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forwardlooking statement”; or (2) the statement is not material; or (3) the plaintiff fails to establish that

35

Case 1:09-cv-11267-GAO Document 63

Filed 06/02/10 Page 44 of 60

the defendant made the statement with actual knowledge of its false or misleading nature. 15
U.S.C. § 78u-5(c)(1) (2010).26
Among other categories, the PSLRA safe harbor applies to “a statement of the plans and
objectives of management for future operations, including plans or objectives relating to the
products or services of the issuer[.]” 15 U.S.C. § 78u-5(i)(1)(B) (2010). This is precisely the
type of statement cited by the plaintiffs regarding Genzyme’s plans for approval of the
Lumizyme BLA. See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 217 (citing Oct. 24, 2007 statement that “we expect the
approval [of the Lumizyme BLA] to occur in the first quarter of next year”); 230 (citing Apr. 21,
2008 conference call stating “we are now predicting the FDA action by the end of this year” and
“now expect that commercialization of the 2000-liter material for late-onset patients in the
United States will start in the first quarter of next year”); 258 (citing November 7, 2008
statement that “We expect the FDA to act on the [Lumizyme] BLA by November 29, 2008”);
264 (citing January 13, 2009 press release statement that the Company “expects to . . . [o]btain
regulatory approvals for larger-scale production of Myozyme” in 2009); 290 (citing March 24,
2009 statement that “[w]e anticipate U.S. approval of . . . Lumizyme, in mid-2000 [sic]”).27
These statements plainly are forward-looking under the statute. See In re Medimmune, Inc. Sec.
Litig., 873 F. Supp. 953, 964 (D. Md. 1995) (“Mere expressions of hope or expectation regarding

26

The common law “bespeaks caution” doctrine was the predecessor to the PSLRA safe harbor and also applies to
preclude liability for securities fraud where a forward-looking statement is accompanied by meaningful cautionary
language. See, e.g., Fitzer v. Sec. Dynamics Techs., 119 F. Supp. 2d. 12, 31 (D. Mass. 2000) (granting motion to
dismiss 10(b) claim under common law “bespeaks caution” doctrine and citing Shaw v. Digital Equip. Corp., 82
F.3d 1194, 1213 (1st Cir. 1996)). Herein, where the defendants reference the PSLRA safe harbor, such reference
should be read to include the parallel common law doctrine as well.
27

For the Court’s benefit, all of the Lumizyme-related forward-looking statements are identified and collected in
Attachment 2.

36

future approval, not worded as guarantees, are not actionable.”); In re PLC Sys. Inc. Sec. Litig.,
41 F. Supp. 2d 106, 117-18 (D. Mass. 1999) (same).28
In addition to their forward-looking nature, each of the statements was accompanied by
meaningful cautionary language on the risk that the FDA might not approve Lumizyme, or might
not do so on the time frame then anticipated by the Company.29 Accordingly, the PSLRA safe
harbor shields all of the alleged misstatements regarding Lumizyme approval from Section 10(b)
liability. See Baron v. Smith, 380 F.3d 49, 53-54 (1st Cir. 2004) (forward-looking statement
accompanied by meaningful cautionary language held not actionable under Section 10(b)).
Thus, as shown above, the alleged misstatements concerning anticipated Lumizyme
approval are not actionable, because (i) the plaintiffs cannot establish that they reasonably relied
on Genzyme’s statements concerning anticipated Lumizyme approval; (ii) the Complaint fails to
allege fraudulent intent sufficient to supply any inference — much less a compelling inference —
of scienter; and (iii) Genzyme’s statements concerning anticipated Lumizyme approval are not
actionable under the PSLRA safe harbor for forward-looking statements, as well as the
“bespeaks caution” doctrine. This Court should dismiss all claims based on such statements.

28

This is not a case where Genzyme guaranteed FDA approval of Lumizyme. As Attachment 2 shows, Genzyme
merely expressed its hope and expectation for approval. Each of Genzyme’s statements was accompanied by
cautionary language that specifically identified the uncertainties inherent in the Lumizyme approval process. These
cautions, coupled with Genzyme’s expressions of anticipation, make clear that Genzyme did not portray Lumizyme
approval as a “when not if” proposition. Compare In re Transkaryotic Therapies, Inc. Sec. Litig., 319 F. Supp. 2d
152, 160-61 (D. Mass. 2004) (“[S]tatements, such as ‘We believe the approval of Replagal in the U.S. remains a
when not if proposition’ . . . arguably do not fall within the safe harbor provisions.”), with In re Bristol-Myers
Squibb Sec. Litig., 312 F. Supp. 2d 549, 558 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (refusing to find statements that defendants were “very
positive about the approval prospects for this drug” and did not “think it’s likely at all that this drug won’t get
approved” constituted guarantees actionable under the securities laws). This is also not a case where Genzyme had
information that seriously undermined the accuracy of its statements. See, e.g., McL. Decl. Ex. C (Press Release,
Oct. 22, 2008) (describing FDA Advisory Committee’s 16-1 vote in support of Lumizyme’s efficacy as treatment
for Pompe disease); cf. In re Amylin Pharms., Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 01-CV-1455, 2003 WL 21500525, at *8 (S.D.
Cal. May 3, 2003).
29

For the Court’s benefit, citations to the relevant, extensive cautionary statements provided by Genzyme alongside
the statements cited in the Complaint are collected in Attachment 2.

Statements Regarding FDA Re-Inspection Are Not Actionable

The Complaint contends that the defendants misled investors by stating during a March 2,
2009 conference call that the Company did not expect that the Lumizyme BLA process would
require re-inspection of the Allston Facility, when the process ultimately did require a second
inspection. See Compl. ¶¶ 281, 287(D); see also id. ¶¶ 307, 310(D). But in the same paragraph
accusing the defendants of falsely representing that re-inspection would not be necessary, the
Complaint directly quotes Mr. Bamforth explaining that while the Company did not anticipate
re-inspection, “‘[c]learly, the FDA has the liberty if they choose to do a follow-up to require
that.’” Compl. ¶ 281. Moreover, as the plaintiffs acknowledge, there can never be any
“assurance” of how or when the FDA will act. Compl. ¶ 93. Because the defendants cautioned
of the chance of re-inspection, the statements simply are not materially misleading — no investor
could cite the statement as a guarantee of no re-inspection — and the statement provides no good
faith basis for a securities fraud claim.30
C.

The Complaint Fails to Allege Any Actionable Misstatement or Omission
Regarding the Contamination Events Experienced in 2008 at Genzyme’s
Geel and Allston Facilities

In September 2008, Genzyme was performing process validation runs at the Geel
Facility, which was built to manufacture Myozyme at the 4000L scale. The facility was not yet
approved for commercial production, and thus its product was not then commercially available to
patients. Genzyme observed a rapid decline in cell productivity during one of several PV runs,
and, consistent with its normal practice, commenced an investigation into the cause. In the
meantime, the plant continued forward to complete the process of gaining regulatory approval
(and secured the first such approval in February 2009). In November 2008, Genzyme observed
30

Moreover, the plaintiffs have not begun to plead how the defendants purportedly knew, as of March 2, 2009, that
re-inspection would later be required by the FDA.

38

Case 1:09-cv-11267-GAO Document 63

at its Allston Facility a decline in cell productivity during a bioreactor run that was involved in
the manufacturing of Myozyme at the 2000L scale (or Lumizyme, as it is called in the U.S.).
Genzyme also commenced an investigation into the cause of this second event.
Plaintiffs assert that Genzyme should have disclosed these two events — which Genzyme
later determined had been caused by viral contamination — at the time they occurred, and they
premise the claim on the theory that these “events” purportedly constrained drug supply,
negatively impacted the Lumizyme BLA, and “foreshadowed” future problems at the Allston
Facility. Omitting them, according to the Complaint, rendered false or misleading nearly every
disclosure Genzyme made between mid-September 2008 and June 16, 2009.31
While Genzyme did not disclose the events themselves until it had more information
concerning their cause — which Genzyme was entitled to do32 — the Company did disclose the
impact those events had on drug supply. Even prior to Fall 2008, Genzyme had cautioned of
tight Myozyme supply through the First Quarter of 2009. See Compl. ¶¶ 109, 131, 137, 264,
270, 296. Shortly after the two events, in January 2009, Genzyme disclosed that it had been
working with stakeholder groups in the Myozyme community (including physicians and patient
organizations) on a Supply Management Plan to preserve supplies of the therapy and prioritize
patients with particularly acute therapeutic needs. See McL. Decl. Ex. J at 4 (Jan. 13, 2009 press
release stating that supplies of Myozyme would be “so tight that there is a risk of delays in order
fulfillment and consequent potential interruptions in therapy”); Compl. ¶ 264.
Meanwhile, European regulators disclosed information concerning the two events in Geel
and Allston. In January 2009, the EMEA issued its own public statement concerning Genzyme’s
31

See Compl. ¶¶ 245, 250, 251, 256, 259(C)-(D), 266, 272(B), 276, 286, 291, 296, 298, 300, 310(A), (D)-(E).

See Higginbotham v. Baxter Int’l, Inc., 495 F.3d 753, 761 (7th Cir. 2007) (“Taking the time necessary to get
things right is both proper and lawful. Managers cannot tell lies but are entitled to investigate for a reasonable time,
until they have a full story to reveal.”).

Supply Management Program. In that public release, the EMEA addressed the implications of
the tight supply of Myozyme; clearly stated that Genzyme had experienced problems at some of
its manufacturing facilities; and also disclosed Genzyme’s ongoing investigation into the cause
of those events. See McL. Decl. Ex. K.33 The Complaint entirely ignores the fact that the
EMEA — like the FDA, a key regulator — released news of the production problems, as well as
the investigation Genzyme was conducting, and thus ignores that the available information
concerning the two events was made public shortly after they occurred. The Complaint also
ignores Genzyme’s disclosures concerning the Myozyme supply constraints allegedly caused, in
part, by the Allston event, instead blithely asserting that the information was “concealed.”
The Company disclosed the results of its investigation of the 2008 Geel and Allston
events — in particular, the fact that both had been the result of contamination by the same virus
— on June 16, 2009 — only after its investigation had concluded. See McL. Decl. Ex. L (Press
Release, June 16, 2009) (“Genzyme has now confirmed that this virus was the cause of declines
in cell productivity at its Allston and Geel facilities in two previous instances in 2008 . . . .”
(emphasis added)).34 The June 16 press release also announced the decline in cell productivity in
a third bioreactor run — this one involving a bioreactor in Allston producing Cerezyme — and
cited the Company’s conclusion that all three events had been caused by the same type of virus.
See McL. Decl. Ex. L (stating that Genzyme had identified the presence of the virus in
connection with the third bioreactor event “over the weekend”); Compl. ¶ 139.

33

In its Form 10-K for 2008, Genzyme also disclosed the write-off it took of material from the incomplete PV run at
Geel. See Compl. ¶¶ 109, 266, 298; McL. Decl. Ex. V at F-23, F-29, F-118 (Form 10-K for 2008, Mar. 2, 2009).

34

On a June 24, 2009 conference call cited by plaintiffs for other purposes, one of the defendants clearly stated that
“it was only as a result of a six month long investigation that we were able to create the specific PCR [test], which
allows us to isolate and identify this virus.” McL. Decl. Ex. M at 4. This confirms that Genzyme’s investigation
lasted into the Spring of 2009. The plaintiffs do not allege that this statement was false in any way.

40

Case 1:09-cv-11267-GAO Document 63

Filed 06/02/10 Page 49 of 60

Against this record — which establishes that Genzyme’s investigation concluded in
Spring 2009 — no alleged fact supports an inference that Genzyme became aware at an earlier
time that a virus had caused the two events. Yet the Complaint is premised on the bald
allegation that Genzyme was required to disclose the viral contamination long before Genzyme
could have done so. See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 245 (alleging failure to disclose “contamination” after it
occurred). In order to adequately plead scienter, the plaintiffs were obligated to plead facts from
which one could draw a strong inference that Genzyme knew material information and withheld
that information with “either conscious intent to defraud or a high degree of recklessness.” ACA
Fin. Guar. Corp. v. Advest, Inc., 512 F.3d 46, 58 (1st Cir. 2008) (internal quotations omitted).
Instead, the plaintiffs simply insist that Genzyme was required to disclose the viral
contamination earlier, without providing any basis for the claim that Genzyme could have done
so. This is not enough to survive dismissal. See N.J. Carpenters, 537 F.3d at 45 (explaining that
a statement or omission “cannot be intentionally misleading if the defendant did not have
sufficient information at the relevant time to form an evaluation that there was a need to disclose
certain information and to form an intent not to disclose it.”); Isham v. Perini Corp., 665 F.
Supp. 2d 28, 35 (D. Mass. 2009) (dismissing Section 10(b) claim for inadequate scienter
pleading where complaint failed to plead that any defendants “were even aware of” the supposed
significance of the information allegedly withheld) (quotations omitted).
In all other respects, too, the plaintiffs’ allegations concerning the Geel and Allston
events fail to satisfy the PSRLA and Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). As noted above, the PSLRA requires
that allegations made on information and belief, as these are, must “state with particularity all
facts on which that belief is formed.” 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1). The Complaint fails even to try
to meet this standard. For example, the plaintiffs loosely suggest that the 2008 Geel event bore

41

Case 1:09-cv-11267-GAO Document 63

Filed 06/02/10 Page 50 of 60

some relationship to the 2008 Form 483, Warning Letter, and Complete Response Letter, but no
particular fact is alleged as a basis for that (erroneous) contention. Even a cursory review of
these pieces of FDA correspondence show that the agency’s inspection of Allston had nothing to
do with the Geel event. See McL. Decl. Exs. A, E, F. Moreover, nowhere in any of the FDA’s
correspondence — including the Complete Response Letter indicating that the Lumizyme BLA
would not be approved at that time — is the Geel contamination (or any viral contamination)
even referenced. See McL. Decl. Ex. F. In the same way, the Complaint asserts that the 2008
Allston contamination established cGMP “violations” and showed that the facility was not in
compliance with cGMPs. See Compl. ¶¶ 105, 242, 259(B). But the FDA’s Warning Letter and
Complete Response Letter regarding cGMPs do not even mention the 2008 Geel or Allston
events. See McL. Decl. Exs. E, F.
Because the plaintiffs have failed to satisfy the requirements of 9(b) and the PSLRA with
respect to pleading scienter, and because the plaintiffs have failed to establish that Genzyme was
required to disclose the 2008 contaminations before it did or that Genzyme was even capable of
doing so, the Court should dismiss all claims stemming from the Fall 2008 contamination events.
D.

The Complaint’s Allegations Relating to Defendants’ General Statements of
Optimism Are Non-Actionable Puffery

The Complaint identifies approximately ten generalized, optimistic statements made by
Genzyme or its officers or directors about the Company’s prospects that the plaintiffs contend
were false or misleading in light of challenges that the Company later encountered. See, e.g.,
Compl. ¶¶ 223 (statement that the Company had an “outlook for strong growth,” and that the
Company felt “bullish” regarding the future), 228 (statement that the Company’s strong growth
“positioned the company well for 2008”), 237 (statement characterizing the second quarter of
2008 as “strong and highly productive” and noting that the Company “set in place a number of

catalysts that will drive near-term growth”).35 But it is well-settled that such vague expressions
of optimism and rosy affirmations are immaterial as a matter of law, not relied upon by investors,
and, consequently, not actionable under the securities laws. Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1217. This rule
applies to both statements about an issuer’s current state of affairs and statements about its future
prospects. In re Boston Tech., Inc. Sec. Litig., 8 F. Supp. 2d 43, 54 (D. Mass. 1998). Such
statements are not actionable because reasonable investors would neither rely on, nor deem
material, vague expressions of optimism that amount to nothing more than puffery. See Shaw,
82 F.3d at 1217 (“In particular, courts have demonstrated a willingness to find immaterial as a

The Complaint Fails to Allege Any Actionable Misstatement or Omission
Regarding Earnings Guidance or Revenue Expectations

The Complaint cites nearly every statement Genzyme made relating to financial
projections or performance during the Putative Class Period, and asserts — without ever
providing specific support for the contention or alleging how the speaker purportedly knew the
statement would prove false — that such statements were materially misleading because the

Here, the statements the plaintiffs cite — referencing “confidence” that the company is “well-positioned,” with a
“strong outlook” and “growth potential” — are precisely the sort of loose expressions of optimism that courts have
held to be non-actionable puffery. See Kenney v. State St. Corp., No. 09-CV-10750, 2010 WL 938333, at *9 (D.
Mass. Mar. 15, 2010) (statement that business was “very strong” “is precisely the sort of corporate macro statement
that courts have deemed nonactionable”); Orton v. Parametric Tech. Corp., 344 F. Supp. 2d 290, 301 (D. Mass.

Company had not disclosed, or factored into its financial guidance, the purportedly poor
“condition” of the Allston facility, the cGMP “violations,” and the “fact” that the contaminations
at the Geel and Allston Facilities constrained supplies of Myozyme, Cerezyme, and
Fabrazyme.37 In addition, the Complaint’s mammoth section detailing the purportedly “false or
misleading statements” is replete with statements regarding financial performance, but lacking in
any specific allegation as to how the statement is alleged to be false. See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 233
(citing Apr. 23, 2008 Press Release and Form 8-K reporting growth of total revenue over the first
quarter of 2008, reasons for revenue growth, and an increase in demand and sales of Myozyme,
Cerezyme, and Fabrazyme); 257 (citing Nov. 7, 2008 Form 10-Q statements regarding growth in
Cerezyme and Fabrazyme sales).38 These statements represent the apotheosis of the plaintiffs’
efforts to pin allegedly omitted information Genzyme had no independent duty to disclose39 to
wholly unassociated affirmative statements, in hopes of arguing that Genzyme’s duty to disclose
arose from the need to make these affirmative statements “not misleading.”
None of Genzyme’s financial projections or statements regarding earnings guidance is
actionable. This is so, first, because the statements qualify for the PSLRA’s safe harbor for
forward-looking statements. The portion of the PSLRA defining the contours of the safe-harbor
includes, among examples of forward-looking statements, statements “containing a projection of
revenues, income (including income loss), earnings (including earnings loss) per share, capital

38

There are at least eight examples of paragraphs in the “False and Misleading Statements” section that contain only
this type of retrospective report on financial performance that the plaintiffs do not even assert were inaccurate. See
Compl. ¶¶ 218, 222, 225, 233, 234, 257, 284, 293. Eleven other paragraphs contain similar historical financial
statements, which the plaintiffs fail allege were false, in addition to other statements. See Compl. ¶¶ 216, 237, 238,

expenditures, dividends, capital structure, or other financial items.” 15 U.S.C. § 78u-5(i)(1)(A)
(2010). The revenue and earnings guidance statements alleged in the Complaint fall squarely
into this category — Genzyme offered forecasts of future performance that were consistently
couched in terms of what Genzyme “expected” or “anticipated.”40 Such language is typical of
forward-looking earnings and revenue projections shielded by the statutory safe harbor. See In
re Smith & Wesson Holding Corp. Sec. Litig., 604 F. Supp. 2d 332, 341 (D. Mass. 2009)
(holding that the PSLRA safe harbor protected defendants’ statements regarding “anticipated
sales, income, income per share . . . [and] capital expenditures” because they were accompanied
by cautionary language); In re Ibis Tech. Sec. Litig., 422 F. Supp. 2d 294, 310-13 (D. Mass.
2006) (holding that statements regarding defendant’s “prospects for booking one to three
implanter orders in 2003” were non-actionable forward looking statements); First Marblehead,
639 F. Supp. 2d at 162 (holding that defendant’s “projections of revenues from the additional
structural advisory fees and residual interests” were non-actionable forward-looking statements);
see also Praecis, 2007 WL 951695 at *9 (finding statements regarding estimates of a drug’s
“revenue opportunity” were forward-looking). Also, as the safe-harbor requires, each statement
was accompanied by meaningful cautionary language citing earnings and revenue guidance
statements as subject to specific risks and uncertainties.41 The plaintiffs simply cannot state a
valid Section 10(b) claim based on forward-looking revenue projections accompanied by
appropriate cautionary language.
The Complaint also fails to allege scienter with respect to these statements. Nowhere
does the Complaint purport to explain whether or how the defendants knew — at the time they

made any of the identified statements regarding financial results or guidance — that the
Company’s performance would fall short of the projections given. Instead, the plaintiffs baldly
assert that the projections were all false or misleading throughout the putative class period,
because they did not take into account the allegedly poor “condition” of the Allston facility, the
Company’s cGMP “violations,” and the “fact” that the 2008 events at the Geel and Allston
Facilities constrained drug supplies. Compl. ¶¶ 220, 227, 236, 241, 259, 262, 265, 272, 287,
300. None of these theories is supported by factual allegations that could give rise to an
inference — strong or otherwise — that the defendants knew that any particular projections or
guidance were unattainable. See Praecis, 2007 WL 951695 at *10 (simply alleging that the
company did not take certain information into account is not enough to state a claim). As an
example, the Complaint posits that “the condition of the Allston plant . . . jeopardized the
Company’s ability to produce sufficient product to meet its projections.” Compl. ¶ 259. This is
plainly insufficient to state an actionable Section 10(b) claim, because the plaintiffs make no
attempt to plead who knew what specific information about the Allston Facility that made it clear
that revenue projections were unattainable, and how and when such information came to be
known. See N.J. Carpenters, 537 F.3d at 48-49 (affirming dismissal for lack of scienter where
plaintiff failed to plead when defendant purportedly knew about problems with its new drug and
how defendants would know that such information presented a material problem). The plaintiffs
simply have not — and cannot — state a claim premised on Genzyme’s financial guidance
during the putative class period.

The Complaint Fails to Allege Any Actionable Misstatement or Omission
Regarding Cerezyme or Fabrazyme

The Complaint identifies two statements regarding the prospects for Cerezyme and
Fabrazyme that the plaintiffs contend were false or misleading because Genzyme purportedly
knew that it could not satisfy the markets for these drugs. See Compl. ¶¶ 219, 268.
First, on October 24, 2007, Genzyme’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Termeer, stated
during an earnings conference call that, for existing Cerezyme patients, “‘we don’t expect there
to be, given the very long term extremely solid experience that we have around Cerezyme to be
any particular reason for patients to shift or to change . . . .”’ Compl. ¶ 219. This statement was
made fully one year prior to the 2008 events in Geel and Allston, one year prior to the receipt of
the October 2008 Form 483 from FDA, and 20 months prior to the events in Allston announced
in June 2009 that first had any impact at all on Cerezyme production. Yet, the plaintiffs contend
that this forward-looking statement was false or misleading, citing all of the same reasons and
pegged to nothing more than the plaintiffs’ insistence that Genzyme “knew” all of it.42
In this respect, plainly, the Complaint fails to satisfy the heightened pleading standards
required by the PSLRA (as well as Tellabs). See Stone & Webster, 414 F.3d at 205-206 (“[T]he
requirement [of particularity] is not satisfied by a pleading which simply asserts that the
defendant knew of the falsity.”); see also Section I supra. Paragraph 220(C), for example,
claims the statement is false because Genzyme was aware of conditions that made it certain that
FDA approval of Lumizyme could not be achieved, despite the fact that the Lumizyme BLA was

42

See Compl. ¶ 220 (asserting that the statement was false or misleading because Genzyme was: not in compliance
with cGMPs, was only able to maintain growth for its products by “overburdening” its Allston Facility, was
diverting manufacturing capacity away from Cerezyme and Fabrazyme to manufacture Myozyme, was engaging in
unspecified “practices” making contamination or FDA action “inevitable,” and because patients would have to
switch to competitors’ products if Genzyme could not supply the market with its own products).

Case 1:09-cv-11267-GAO Document 63

not submitted until May 2008 — seven months after the statement in question even was made.
Scienter cannot be alleged by hindsight. See First Marblehead, 639 F. Supp. 2d at 160.43
Still another statement cited by the plaintiffs regarding Cerezyme and Fabrazyme is the
set of forward-looking projections for 2009 sales presented by the Company’s Chief Financial
Officer, Michael Wyzga, during a February 11, 2009 earnings conference call. See Compl. ¶
268. Again, the plaintiffs allege that these statements were false or misleading for the same
reasons repeatedly cited throughout the Complaint, i.e., that Genzyme failed to disclose cGMP
“violations,” receipt of the Form 483, the occurrence of the contamination events in Geel and
Allston in 2008, that the Allston Facility was “overburdened,” and that it could not manufacture
sufficient Cerezyme or Fabrazyme to meet demand. See Compl. ¶¶ 259, 272.
But here, too, the Complaint fails — in all of the same ways that the defendants have
articulated throughout this memorandum — to allege any specific facts that would support a
strong inference of any defendant’s actual knowledge on February 11, 2009 that Cerezyme and
Fabrazyme sales would later fall short of the projections announced that day. It was not until
four months later, in June 2009, in response to the May 2009 Allston contamination, that
Genzyme announced it would close the Allston Facility for decontamination, and that those
actions would have a material impact on anticipated Cerezyme and Fabrazyme sales. See McL.
Decl. Exs. L, SS; Compl. ¶¶ 13, 151. Apart from the usual hash of conclusory allegations
offered by the plaintiffs to show what the defendants purportedly “knew” at the time the
43

Mr. Termeer’s October 2007 statement regarding Cerezyme patients also was a forward-looking statement
relating to guidance for 2011 that was accompanied by meaningful cautionary language. See McL. Decl. Ex. X at 3
(Tr. of Earnings Conf. Call, Oct. 24, 2007) (at the beginning of the call, Genzyme’s Vice-President for Investor
Relations warned investors, “On this call we will discuss Genzyme’s future financial outlook and business plans and
strategies. We will be making forward-looking statements including our non-GAAP earnings estimates and growth
rates for the next five years, our product development plans and regulatory action estimates including for . . .
Myozyme manufacturing. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and
our actual results may differ materially. Please refer to the June 30, Form 10-Q on file with the SEC for more
information.”). Thus, it also falls within the PSLRA’s safe harbor and cannot serve as the foundation for a securities
fraud claim. See Section III. E., supra.

statement was made — i.e., that the Allston Facility was in violation of cGMPs; that the
Company had “overburdened” that facility; the alleged “depth and pervasiveness” of the
Company’s “woefully deficient compliance practices” in Allston — the Complaint offers no
specific facts to suggest that the February 2009 Cerezyme and Fabrazyme projections were not
fully supported at the time. In this respect, the allegation as to the Company’s February 2009
Fabrazyme and Cerezyme guidance fails to satisfy scienter pleading requirements.
Plaintiffs’ claim regarding the February 11, 2009 Cerezyme and Fabrazyme projections
also fails because the statement was forward-looking and accompanied by meaningful cautionary
language. See McL. Decl. Ex. EE at 3 (Tr. of Earnings Conf. Call, Feb. 11, 2009).44 As
discussed in Section III. E., supra, these statements are subject to the PSLRA safe harbor, and
therefore cannot serve as the basis for a Section 10(b) claim.

The Complaint Fails to Allege Any Actionable Misstatement or Omission
Regarding Genzyme’s Decisions on the Marketing of Lumizyme (2000L)

Plaintiffs allege that Genzyme failed to disclose a March 2009 “internal decision” to meet
United States Myozyme demand with 4000L product produced at Geel rather than continuing to
pursue FDA approval 2000L Lumizyme. The plaintiffs contend that the Company’s failure to
disclose that decision rendered its statements regarding Lumizyme plans materially misleading.
See Compl. ¶¶ 280, 283, 318, 320. But none of the statements identified by the plaintiffs can
support a viable Section 10(b) claim.45

44

At the beginning of the February 11, 2009 call, Genzyme’s Director of Investor Relations cautioned investors,
“On this call we will be discussing Genzyme’s future financial outlook, business plans and strategies and we will be
making forward-looking statements including discussing our earnings, revenue and expense forecast, our
development and regulatory approval plans and estimated timetables for several products and development programs
including alglucosidase alfa . . . . These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and
uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially. Please refer to the risk factor section of our
September 30, 10-Q for more information on those risks.” McL. Decl. Ex. EE at 3.

45

Notably, several statements identified in the Complaint were made before the plaintiffs contend that Genzyme
made an “internal decision” not to market Lumizyme. The plaintiffs cite a December 15, 2009 reference by Mr.
Termeer to the company’s decision regarding Lumizyme on an unspecified date in March 2009. See Compl. ¶ 126.

49

Case 1:09-cv-11267-GAO Document 63

As an initial matter, the allegation fails on its face to establish loss causation — also an
element of a Section 10(b) claim, see Dura, 544 U.S. at 342 — because the allegedly
“corrective” disclosure was made well after the end of the putative class period. A motion to
dismiss must be granted where — as here — the plaintiff fails adequately to allege that a
material misstatement or omission was the cause of the actual loss suffered. See In re Polaroid
Corp. Sec. Litig., 134 F. Supp. 2d 176, 188 (D. Mass. 2001) (internal quotations omitted)
(granting motion to dismiss for failure to establish loss causation because “[a] plaintiff must
allege that the misstatements were the reason the transaction turned out to be a losing one”). To
establish loss causation:
a plaintiff must allege . . . that the subject of the fraudulent statement or omission
was the cause of the actual loss suffered, i.e., that the misstatement or omission
concealed something from the market that, when disclosed, negatively affected
the value of the security. Otherwise, the loss is not foreseeable.
In re Alkermes Sec. Litig., No. 03-CV-12091, 2005 WL 2848341, at *11 (D. Mass. Oct. 6, 2005)
(quoting Lentell v. Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., 396 F.3d 161 (2d Cir. 2005)) (quotations omitted).
There can be no dispute that the plaintiffs have failed to plead any causal link between
the information allegedly withheld — that is, Genzyme’s decision regarding which specific
production scale would be used to meet demand in a particular market — and the loss the
plaintiffs allegedly suffered — a drop in the Company’s stock price. See Compl. ¶¶ 321, 322.
Indeed, the Complaint fails to even include the decision not to market Lumizyme produced at the
2000L scale in its loss causation allegations. Id. This is hardly surprising, since it is not possible
that any relevant drop in the market price of Genzyme’s stock during the putative class period
was attributable to the purportedly “corrective” disclosure of the decision regarding Lumizyme.

Thus, even if it is assumed true that Genzyme made that decision at some point in March 2009, the plaintiffs’ failure
to specify a date in March forecloses any viable claim of a misstatement or omission made prior to the end of that
month. See Compl. ¶¶ 280, 283.

50

Case 1:09-cv-11267-GAO Document 63

Filed 06/02/10 Page 59 of 60

The plaintiffs themselves claim that the corrective disclosure was made on December 15, 2009
— a full month after the end of the putative class period. Compl. ¶ 126. Loss causation cannot
be present where no corrective disclosure of the purportedly “true” facts can possibly have been
the cause of a stock price decline and any resulting injury to the plaintiffs during a relevant time.
Because the Complaint fails in this way to allege an essential element of a securities fraud claim,
the alleged “omission” cannot survive a motion to dismiss.
Moreover, while the Complaint seeks to make much of Genzyme’s failure to disclose the
March 2009 decision to meet United States demand with the larger scale 4000L product rather
than continue to pursue the sale of 2000L Lumizyme, the plaintiffs cannot allege — and have not
alleged beyond conclusory ‘say so’ — that the information even was material. The Complaint
was required to “articulate facts that show how the omitted information would have significantly
altered the total mix of information available to the market.” Praecis, 2007 WL 951695 at *18.
Nowhere do the plaintiffs even attempt to explain how disclosure in March 2009 would
have altered the “total mix” of information available to the market. Genzyme announced well
before March 2009 that it intended to pursue approval of 4000L Lumizyme in the United States
— thus the plaintiffs cannot suggest that the Company’s growing emphasis on the larger scale
version of Lumizyme was somehow hidden. See McL. Decl. Ex. CC at 13, 17 (Tr. of Earnings
Conf. Call, Oct. 22, 2008) (discussing seeking 4000L approval in U.S.); Ex. J at 2 (Press Release
and Form 8-K, Jan. 13, 2009) (“The company anticipates filing for U.S. approval for the 4000L
manufacturing process during the first half of this year.”). In fact, the very disclosures the
Complaint characterize as fraudulent in this regard specified the Company’s plans to submit an
sBLA for 4000L Lumizyme that would replace the smaller scale 2000L Lumizyme production.
See McL. Decl. Ex. FF at 4, 10, 11 (Tr. of Investor Conf. Call, Mar. 2, 2009); Ex. V at 9 (Form

10-K for 2008, Mar. 2, 2009); Ex. TT (Press Release and Form 8-K, Apr. 22, 2009); Ex. OO at
18 (Press Release and Form 8-K, Oct. 21, 2009). In short, the Company realized that its ability
to sell Lumizyme produced at the 4000L scale rendered unnecessary the marketing of 2000L
Lumizyme in the U.S. It is telling that the Complaint does not suggest that the larger scale
product would be unable to “fill Lumizyme’s shoes” for the United States market — rather, the
plaintiffs simply quibble with the Company’s disclosures without addressing in any specific
manner how the disclosures were materially misleading at all. In view of the extensive
disclosures made by the defendant regarding its intention to pursue 4000L approval and the lack
of any allegation that the “internal decision” would result in a shortfall of product in any market,
the plaintiffs cannot possibly claim that any alleged omissions regarding Lumizyme plans would
alter the total mix of information available. For this additional reason, their claim based on this
statement should be dismissed.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the defendants respectfully request that the Court dismiss the
plaintiffs’ Complaint in its entirety, with prejudice.
