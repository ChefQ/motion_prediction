MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION
TO CLAIMANT, AMERINDO SERVICES LTD’S, MOTION TO DISMISS ARREST
NOW INTO COURT, through undersigned counsel, comes complainant, Gulf Marine
Fabricators, LP (“Gulf Marine”), who respectfully submits this Memorandum in Opposition to
the Motion to Dismiss Arrest filed by defendant Amerindo Services, Ltd. (“Amerindo”) (R. Doc.
62). Amerindo’s Motion to Dismiss addresses the issue of whether the in rem defendant the
ATP INNOVATOR (the “INNOVATOR”) is a vessel. The issue of vessel status was previously
before the Magistrate Judge on Amerindo’s Motion to Vacate but without any jurisdictional
discovery. Now that the parties have had the benefit of jurisdictional discovery, the evidence is
clear that the INNOVATOR is a vessel because it is practically capable of transporting both
people and equipment across navigable waters. Accordingly, Amerindo’s Motion to Dismiss
should be denied.

I.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
A.

The Parties’ 2015 Layberth Agreement

This case arises out of the failure by defendants Amerindo Services, Ltd. (“Amerindo”)
and Blue Sky Langsa Ltd. (“Blue Sky”) to pay Gulf Marine over $1,000,000.00 in dockage and
other services provided by Gulf Marine to the ATP INNOVATOR, a semi-submersible rig
berthed at Gulf Marine’s dock. (R. Doc. 1, ¶¶ VII, XII). Pursuant to a Layberth Agreement,
Amerindo and Blue Sky agreed to pay Gulf Marine $55,000 per month to dock the ATP
INNOVATOR at Gulf Marine’s facility. (Id., ¶ VIII). In addition, Amerindo and Blue Sky
agreed to pay Gulf Marine for services provided to the INNOVATOR. (Id.). To date, Gulf
Marine is owed well over $1,200,000, which figure continues to accrue daily. (Id., ¶ XII).
B.

The INNOVATOR

The INNOVATOR was built in 1976 as a semi-submersible vessel1 and was originally
called the ROWAN MIDLAND. (See Abstract of Title, attached as Exhibit 1). Jurisdictional
discovery on the issue of vessel status has confirmed that, as a mobile offshore vessel, the
INNOVATOR is practically capable of transporting people and equipment over navigable water.
Specifically, Amerindo’s Joseph Key testified as follows:
Q

You would agree with me that the ATP Innovator has design capabilities to
actually transport people from one location to another because it, in fact, did
transport on that instance correct?
***

1

A semi-submersible vessel is a specialized marine vessel used in a number of offshore roles, such as an
offshore drilling rig, safety vessel, oil production facility, or heavy lift crane. (See Declaration of Todd Ladd, ¶ 2,
attached as Exhibit 2). With its hull structure submerged at a deep draft, a semi-submersible is less affected by wave
loadings than a normal ship. (Id.). With a small water-plane area, however, the semi-submersible is sensitive to
load changes, and therefore must be carefully trimmed to maintain stability. (Id.). Unlike a submersible, a semisubmersible vessel is not supported by resting on the seabed. (Id.). Semi-submersible vessels are able to transform
from a deep to a shallow draft by de-ballasting (removing ballast water from the hull), thereby becoming surface
vessels. (Id.). Typically, they are moved from location to location in this configuration. (Id.).

A:

I would say that it has the design to accommodate people.

Q:

(By Mr. Baldwin) And it also has the design capabilities to move people from one
location to another just like it did on the tow from location in February of 2014 to
Gulf Marine’s facility, correct?

A:

Yes2
***

Q:

And so during that tow from the on-site location to Gulf Marine’s facility, the
ATP Innovator moved equipment from one location to another, correct?

A:

And from that, you know that the ATP Innovator was and had the design
capabilities to move equipment from one location to another, correct?
***

A:

Correct.3

Like a typical semi-submersible, the INNOVATOR was constructed with a steel hull and
twenty-five (25) ballast tanks to insure her ability to float. (Exh. 2, Id., ¶ 4). She has the typical
semi-submersible configuration described above, with a watertight bulkhead and additional tanks
for fuel, cement, water, and mud to support her function as a mobile drilling vessel. (Id.). The
INNOVATOR is a United-States flag vessel documented under the laws of the United States,
having been registered with the United States Coast Guard’s National Vessel Documentation
Center and issued Official Number 575567.4

The INNOVATOR was issued a “Registry”

endorsement with the United States Coast Guard5 and is an inspected vessel by the United States

See Certified Copy of Certificate of Documentation, attached as Exhibit 4. Under 46 C.F.R. § 67.111, the
National Vessel Documentation Center issues an official number to a vessel upon initial documentation of the vessel
with the National Vessel Documentation Center. The official number must be permanently affixed to the vessel. 46
C.F.R. § 67.121.

See Exh. 4. Under 46 C.F.R. § 67.17, a “registry endorsement entitles to employment in the foreign trade;
trade with Guam, American Samoa, Wake, Midway, or Kingman Reef; and any other employment for which a
coastwise, or fishery endorsement is not required.”

Coast Guard. As an inspected vessel, she received a Certificate of Inspection from the United
States Coast Guard that expired in February of 2016. As a documented vessel, she received a
Certificate of Documentation from the United States Coast Guard that expired in September of
2016. (See Exh. 4). The INNOVATOR is classed with the American Bureau of Shipping
(“ABS”), which has conducted regular surveys of the vessel. (Ladd Declaration, ¶ 15, Exh. 2)
She also has International Maritime Organization (“IMO”) Number 8754633, and Hull Number
742.6
The INNOVATOR has a long history in the Gulf of Mexico7 and the Atlantic Ocean,8
having worked on several jobs at several different sites. In 2007, ATP Oil & Gas Corporation
(“ATP”) bought the semi-submersible, changed her name to the “ATP INNOVATOR,” and
granted a preferred ship mortgage on the INNOVATOR. (See Abstract of Title, Exh. 1).9 ATP
converted the INNOVATOR from a semi-submersible drilling rig to a semi-submersible
production rig. (Ladd Declaration, ¶ 5, Exh. 2). The conversion consisted of removing drilling
equipment and replacing it with production equipment. (Id.).
Notably, the hull, superstructure, tanks and vessel qualities of the semi-submersible were
not changed or affected in the conversion process. (Id.).10 In all respects, the INNOVATOR
remained a semi-submersible and continues to be a semi-submersible with inherent capabilities

Under 33 C.F.R. 181.23, manufacturers of vessels are required to identify each vessel with primary and
secondary hull identification numbers permanently affixed to the vessel.

492, 493 (D.R.I. 1988) (involving personal injury when ROWAN MIDLAND was being used for drilling operations
in the Atlantic Ocean).

For a ship mortgage to be a valid first preferred mortgage within the meaning of Chapter 313 of Title 46
of the United States Code, the property that is mortgaged must be a vessel. See 46 U.S.C. § 31322.

of moving from job site to job site. (Id.). Indeed, the documents produced by Amerindo in this
case have continued to identify the INNOVATOR as a vessel post-conversion,11 describing the
INNOVATOR as follows:

Although Amerindo’s Motion to Dismiss claims that the INNOVATOR is immobile, Amerindo
markets and promotes the INNOVATOR as a Mobile Offshore Production Unit on its website.12
Amerindo further markets the INNOVATOR on Amerindo’s website as presently docked at Gulf
Marine’s facility, awaiting charter.13

Winches

(Exh. 2, Id., ¶ 6).
In January of 2014, the INNOVATOR was towed to Ingleside, Texas to a berth at Gulf
Marine’s dock. (Id., ¶ 9). The INNOVATOR was a “wet tow,” meaning that she was seaworthy
and capable of floating on her own during the transport to Gulf Marine’s facility. (Id.). In the
opinion of Amerindo’s Joseph Key, the INNOVATOR was “seaworthy” at the time of the tow.14
During the tow, the INNOVATOR had a crew on board which assisted in the tow and berthing at
Gulf Marine’s facility. (Id.). Upon reaching the port of Corpus Christi, a pilot boarded the
INNOVATOR to assist in mooring her at Gulf Marine’s facility. (Id.). The INNOVATOR’s
crew operated winches onboard the semi-submersible to moor her at Gulf Marine’s dock. (Id.).

{N3438659.1}

Case 2:16-cv-00430 Document 64 Filed in TXSD on 07/26/17 Page 7 of 26

On September 14, 2015, ATP Partners sold the INNOVATOR to defendant Amerindo.
(See Abstract of Title, Exh. 1). Subsequently, Amerindo documented the INNOVATOR with
the United States Coast Guard’s National Vessel Documentation Center; and Amerindo granted
ATP Partners a Preferred Ship Mortgage on the INNOVATOR. (Id.). On December 13, 2015,
Amerindo, and its affiliate Blue Sky Langsa, Ltd, entered into a Layberth Agreement with Gulf
Marine to continue berthing the INNOVATOR at Gulf Marine’s dock (the “2015 Layberth
Agreement”) through June 30, 2016 and thereafter on a month-to-month basis not to exceed
December 31, 2016. (See 2015 Layberth Agreement, a copy of which is attached as an exhibit to
the Ladd Declaration, Exh. 2). The INNOVATOR has remained at Gulf Marine’s facility since
December of 2015, but has been moved at least once at the facility. (Ladd Declaration, ¶ 10,
Exh. 2). During the recent movement of the INNOVATOR, she had line-handling crew on
board, who operated the winches on the semi-submersible to assist in moving the INNOVATOR.
(Id., ¶ 13). In addition, there was a pilot on board the INNOVATOR during the move. (Id.).
The INNOVATOR had GPS equipment and a laptop with navigation software to assist with the
move.15
Moreover, the INNOVATOR has twenty-five (25) ballast tanks and a hull ballast system
that was adjusted on a weekly basis prior to hurricane season to maintain the level and/or draft of
the INNOVATOR. (R. Doc. 23-2, ¶¶ 3-4, 14). As evidenced by the Declaration of Joseph Key,
Amerindo intends to put the INNOVATOR into service abroad, which will require the
INNOVATOR to be towed a substantial distance across navigable waters to its intended location

in foreign waters. (See R. Doc. 21-1, pp. 2-3, ¶ 3). If the move requires a wet tow, the
INNOVATOR will transport crew and equipment from Point A to Point B.16
II.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
On October 13, 2016, Gulf Marine filed this lawsuit against the INNOVATOR in rem

and Amerindo and Blue Sky in personam. (R. Doc. 1). Gulf Marine asserted a claim against the
INNOVATOR for a maritime lien for necessaries provided under the Layberth Agreement and
sought to arrest the INNOVATOR under Rule C of the Supplemental Rules for Admiralty and
Maritime (“Rule C”).17 (Id.). On October 17, 2016, the INNOVATOR was arrested by the
United States Marshal’s Service.

(R. Doc. 19).

Subsequently, Amerindo made a limited

appearance on behalf of the INNOVATOR (R. Doc. 20) and filed a Motion to Vacate the arrest
under Rule E(4)(f) of the Supplemental Rules for Admiralty and Maritime Claims, arguing that
the INNOVATOR is not a vessel. (R. Doc. 21). Amerindo’s Motion to Vacate was referred to
Magistrate Judge B. Janice Ellington. (Id.).
On December 14, 2016, before the parties had the opportunity to conduct jurisdictional
discovery, Magistrate Judge B. Janice Ellington issued a Memorandum and Recommendation,
recommending that the Motion to Vacate be granted and that the orders related to the seizure of
the INNOVATOR be vacated. (R. Doc. 29). The basis for the Magistrate’s Recommendation
was the conclusion that the INNOVATOR is not a vessel. (Id.). On December 28, 2016, Gulf
Marine filed a Motion for Review before the District Court of the Magistrate Judge’s
Memorandum and Recommendation. (R. Doc. 30).

16

Id., 72:8-73:5.

17

Gulf Marine also asserted in personam claims against Amerindo and Blue Sky for breach of the Layberth
Agreement. (R. Doc. 1).

{N3438659.1}

8

Case 2:16-cv-00430 Document 64 Filed in TXSD on 07/26/17 Page 9 of 26

On April 5, 2017, after oral argument on Gulf Marine’s Motion, the District Court
sustained Gulf Marine’s first objection to the Magistrate’s Memorandum and Recommendation,
“finding that the correct standard of proof at this stage is probable cause and not a preponderance
of the evidence.” (R. Doc. 55). The District Court allowed Gulf Marine sixty (60) days to
conduct jurisdictional discovery and ordered that any motion to dismiss by Amerindo be filed by
July 5, 2017. (Id.). In the interim, the parties took the deposition of the Amerindo’s Joseph Key,
who provided an affidavit in support of Amerindo’s original motion to vacate. Gulf Marine also
propounded written discovery upon Amerindo, which produced a significant amount of
documents on the issue of vessel status. As stated below, the deposition of Joseph Key and the
documents provided by Amerindo in discovery support the INNOVATOR’s status as a vessel
and warrant the denial of Amerindo’s Motion to Dismiss.
II.

LAW AND ANALYSIS
A.

Standard of Review

Amerindo’s Motion to Dismiss seeks dismissal on the grounds that the INNOVATOR is
not a vessel. Vessel status is a prerequisite of Gulf Marine’s maritime lien claim against the in
rem defendant INNOVATOR. See 46 U.S.C. § 31342(a)(1); see also Galehead Inc. v. M/V
ANGLIA, 183 F.3d 1242, 1244 (11th Cir. 1999). The issue of vessel status is necessarily one of
jurisdictional fact that is interwoven with the merits of Gulf Marine’s claims because the lack of
vessel status defeats Gulf Marine’s maritime lien claims. Accordingly, Amerindo’s Motion to
Dismiss should be treated as a motion for summary judgment subject to the standards of Rule 56
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Martin v. Fab-Con, Inc., 9 F. Supp. 642, 645-46
(E.D. La. 2014) (treating motion to dismiss based on vessel status as a motion for summary
judgment because the issue of vessel status was a crucial component of the plaintiff’s case).

{N3438659.1}

9

Case 2:16-cv-00430 Document 64 Filed in TXSD on 07/26/17 Page 10 of 26

Summary judgment is proper where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and
the moving party is entitled to a judgment as matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). All inferences
from the record must be construed in the light most favorable to the non-movant. Matsushita
Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574 (1986).

The moving party must

demonstrate the absence of genuine issues of material fact, and if the moving party fails to meet
this initial burden, the motion should be denied regardless of the non-movant’s response. Little
v. Liquid Air Corp, 37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir. 1994).
2.

The Elements of a Maritime Lien for Necessaries

“[A] maritime lien is a rough security device invented in the nineteenth century to keep
ships moving in commerce while preventing them from escaping their debts by sailing away.”
THOMAS J. SCHOENBAUM, ADMIRALTY AND MARITIME LAW § 9-1 (5th ed.)
(Updated Nov. 2016). The overarching goal of the maritime lien system is to keep “the channels
of maritime commerce open—by ensuring that people who service vessels have an efficient way
of demanding reimbursement for their labor and are thus willing to perform the services
necessary to keep vessels in operation.” Mullane v. Chambers, 438 F.3d 132, 138 (1st Cir. 2006).
Thus, under Rule C of the Supplemental Rules for Admiralty and Maritime Claims, a party may
bring an action in rem to enforce a maritime lien by seizing the vessel itself until the lien is
satisfied. Supp. Adm. R. C(1)(a). A court may order the sale of an arrested vessel, and that sale
then extinguishes all liens against the vessel. See Newpark Shipbuilding & Repair, Inc. v. M/V
Trinton Brute, 2 F.3d 572, 573 (5th Cir. 1993) (“a marshal’s sale discharges all liens against the
ship and grants the purchaser title free and clear of liens”).

{N3438659.1}

10

Case 2:16-cv-00430 Document 64 Filed in TXSD on 07/26/17 Page 11 of 26

The Commercial Instruments and Maritime Lien Act, 46 U.S.C. § 31301, et seq. (the
“CIMLA”), defines the circumstances in which a party is entitled to a maritime lien for
necessaries. The statute provides that:
[A] person providing necessaries to a vessel on the order of the owner or a person
authorized by the owner—
(1)

has a maritime lien on the vessel;

(2)

may bring a civil action in rem to enforce the lien; and

(3)

is not required to allege or prove in the action that credit was given
to the vessel.

46 U.S.C. § 31342. In sum, to establish a maritime lien for necessaries, the lien claimant must
show that it (1) furnished repairs, supplies, or other necessaries (2) to a vessel (3) on the order of
the owner or a person authorized by the owner. 46 U.S.C. § 31342(a)(1); see also Galehead Inc.
v. M/V ANGLIA, 183 F.3d 1242, 1244 (11th Cir. 1999). For present purposes, the only element
in dispute is the second element: whether the INNOVATOR is a “vessel” for purposes of the
CIMLA. Amerindo does not contest the other two elements of a necessaries lien, i.e. the fact
that the services and equipment provided by Gulf Marine constitute necessaries18 or the fact that
the services were provided on the order of the owner of the INNOVATOR.
3.

The INNOVATOR Constitutes a Vessel under the General Maritime Law

A “vessel” is defined by statute as “every description of watercraft or other artificial
contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water.” 1 U.S.C. § 3.
The Supreme Court has explained that the statutory definition of “vessel” includes “any
watercraft practically capable of maritime transportation, regardless of its primary purpose or
state of transit at a particular moment.” Stewart v. Dutra Construction Co., 543 U.S. 481, 497
18

It is well-settled that dockage or wharfage constitute necessaries. See SCHOENBAUM, ADMIRALTY
AND MARITIME LAW § 9-3 (citing The Western Wave, 77 F.2d 695 (5th Cir. 1935)).

{N3438659.1}

11

Case 2:16-cv-00430 Document 64 Filed in TXSD on 07/26/17 Page 12 of 26

(2005).19 Therefore, for a thing to be classified as a vessel, its primary purpose does not have to
be navigation or transportation. Id. at 495–96. In Stewart, the Supreme Court described the
relevant inquiry in determining vessel status as “whether the watercraft’s use as a means of
transportation on water is a practical possibility or merely a theoretical one.” Id. at 496.
The Supreme Court in Stewart considered whether a massive dredge known as the Super
Scoop qualified as a vessel. The Court noted that the Super Scoop had limited means of selfpropulsion, but that she was able to move short distances. The structure also had “a captain and
crew, navigational lights, ballast tanks, and a crew dining area.” 543 U.S. at 484. Although
maritime transportation was not the primary purpose of the Super Scoop and the structure was
not in navigation at the time of the incident giving rise to dispute, the Court held that the
structure was still a vessel because the Super Scoop was engaged in maritime transportation
while traversing a navigable waterway with equipment and workers. The Court further stated
that “[b]y including special-purpose vessels like dredges, § 3 sweeps broadly . . .” Id. at 494..
Under Stewart, the INNOVATOR is a vessel.

Like the dredge in Stewart, the

INNOVATOR has the capability to, and in fact does, regularly adjust its position to ensure its
draft.

Specifically, the ballast tanks or hull ballast system of the INNOVATOR regularly

position the INNOVATOR. The INNOVATOR has twenty-five (25) ballast tanks and a hull
ballast system that were adjusted on a weekly basis prior to hurricane season to maintain the
level and/or draft of the INNOVATOR. (R. Doc. 23-2, ¶¶ 3-4, 14). This hull ballast system
19

In Stewart, the Supreme Court explained that the Rules of Construction Act, 1 U.S.C. § 3, supplies the
default definition of “vessel” throughout the United States Code “‘unless the context indicates otherwise.’” 543
U.S. at 489-90. “Section 3 merely codified the meaning that the term ‘vessel’ had acquired in general maritime law.
See 1 S. Friedell, Benedict on Admiralty § 165 (rev. 7th ed. 2004). In the decades following its enactment, § 3 was
regularly used to define the term ‘vessel’ in maritime jurisprudence.” Id. at 490. Section 3 has supplied the
definition of “vessel” for purposes of the Jones Act and the Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act. Id.
at 491. Likewise, Section 3 has supplied the definition of “vessel” for purposes of the CIMLA. Louisiana Int’l
Marine, L.L.C., 2012 WL 4718558, at *4; see also Pleason v. Gulfport Shipbuilding Corp., 221 F.2d 621, 623 (5th
Cir. 1955) (applying Section 3’s definition of “vessel” to enforcement of a necessaries lien).

{N3438659.1}

12

Case 2:16-cv-00430 Document 64 Filed in TXSD on 07/26/17 Page 13 of 26

maintained the position of the INNOVATOR. The INNOVATOR has inherent vessel features
that, like the Super Scoop’s vessel features, have been used regularly to maintain its position
while afloat in navigable waters. (Id.).
Furthermore, the Supreme Court recently provided additional guidance for courts to
consider in “borderline cases where ‘capacity’ to transport over water is in doubt.”20 Lozman v.
City of Riviera Beach, Fla., 133 S. Ct. 735, 745 (2013). The Supreme Court held that a thing is
not a vessel “unless a reasonable observer, looking to the [thing’s] physical characteristics and
activities, would consider it designed to a practical degree for carrying people or things over
water.” Id. at 741, 744–45. The Lozman Court stated that while lack of self-propulsion may be a
“relevant” factor to consider in determining vessel status, it “is not dispositive.” 133 S. Ct. at
741 (citing The Robert W. Parsons, 191 U.S. 17, 31 (1903)).
Moreover, under Lozman, the INNOVATOR is a vessel because it is practically designed
to be mobile and to transport both people and equipment as necessary.

It is completely

misleading for Amerindo to contend on the one hand that the INNOVATOR is immobile21 but
then to market the INNOVATOR as a mobile production unit awaiting charter. Moreover,
Amerindo’s Joseph Key readily admitted that the INNOVATOR is actually capable of
transporting both people and equipment over navigable waters because the INNOVATOR has

20

Semi-submersibles have never been “borderline cases” unless they are permanently attached to the
seabed, casting their capacity to transport over water in doubt.
21
In this regard, Amerindo’s stated intent of moving the INNOVATOR to a permanent or semi-permanent
location at some undefined point in time in the future also has no bearing on the issue of vessel status. Such a
subjective test is contrary to the Supreme Court’s statement that the test for vessel status looks at objective
manifestations, not the subjective intent of the owner. Lozman v. City of Riviera Beach, Fla., 133 S. Ct. 735, 744
(2013) (agreeing that owner’s intent is often “‘unverifiable’” and “too easily manipulated” such that it would “invite
gamesmanship.”). Otherwise, vessel owners like Amerindo would be able to slide their vessels in and out of vessel
status simply to avoid maritime liens.

{N3438659.1}

13

Case 2:16-cv-00430 Document 64 Filed in TXSD on 07/26/17 Page 14 of 26

done so in the past.22 The simple fact that transportation of people or equipment is not the
INNOVATOR’s primary function has no bearing on the issue of whether the INNOVATOR is a
vessel. See Stewart, 543 U.S. at 495-96.
Amerindo cites to the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Baker v. Director, Office of Workers’
Compensation Programs, 834 F.3d 542 (5th Cir. 2016) as support for dismissal. In Baker, the
Fifth Circuit addressed whether a tension-leg platform called Big Foot was a vessel. 834 F.3d at
544-48. The Fifth Circuit discussed the characteristics of Big Foot, noting several undisputed
facts in the case. The appellate court stressed that the tension-leg platform was “only intended to
travel over water once in the next twenty years” to a field where it will be permanently attached
to the seabed. Id. at 547. In addition, the parties conceded that Big Foot was not built to
regularly transport goods or people, and the Fifth Circuit noted that the tension-leg platform
lacked means of self-propulsion, requiring it to be towed to move over water. Id. at 544. Based
on these undisputed facts, the Fifth Circuit held that a reasonable observer would not consider
Big Foot to be designed to a practical degree for carrying people or things over water. Id. at 547.
Unlike in Baker, the evidence submitted by Gulf Marine establishes the mobile nature
and design of the INNOVATOR, as does the testimony supporting the INNOVATOR’s practical
capabilities of maritime transportation and the INNOVATOR’s regular ballasting/deballasting to
maintain the INNOVATOR’s position. (See R. Doc. 23-2, ¶¶ 3-5). This evidence is critical to
distinguishing Big Foot from the INNOVATOR. Moreover, as one post-Lozman court properly
held, the mere fact that a mobile offshore unit does not move for a number of years does not
remove it from vessel status. See BW Offshore USA, LLC, 145 F. Supp. 3d at 663-64 (finding
that floating offshore production platform was a vessel despite the fact that it had not moved

from location in four years). Additionally, the INNOVATOR’s minimal movement since she
was first berthed at Gulf Marine’s facility is a function of her owner’s financial difficulties,
which have no bearing on the INNOVATOR’s status as a vessel. (See R. Doc. 23, p. 7) (“The
Innovator is currently berthed for economic reasons.”). It is not a result of the INNOVATOR’s
lack of mobility; and as a result, it is improper to use the INNOVATOR’s lack of movement
since being towed to Gulf Marine as a basis to find the INNOVATOR not to be a vessel.
Likewise, the lack of significant movement prior to being towed to the Gulf Marine facility was
partially due to the bankruptcy of her former owner.

The financial difficulties of the

INNOVATOR’s present and past owners should not affect the issue of vessel status as a matter
of law.
Likewise, the conversion of the INNOVATOR to a production rig did not change the
vessel status of the INNOVATOR because it simply “consisted of removing drilling equipment
and replacing it with production equipment.” (R. Doc. 23-2, ¶ 5). As stated in the Declaration
submitted by Gulf Marine in its Opposition, “[t]he hull, superstructure, tanks and vessel qualities
of the semi-submersible were not changed or affected in the conversion process. In all respects,
the INNOVATOR remained a semi-submersible and continues to be a semi-submersible with
inherent capabilities of moving from job site to job site.” (Id.). As a result, the conversion did
not affect or change vessel status, and the conversion is not a basis for finding the INNOVATOR
to be a non-vessel.
The INNOVATOR’s status as a vessel is in line with the Fifth Circuit’s legion of cases
which have repeatedly held that mobile offshore drilling units like the INNOVATOR are vessels
under the General Maritime Law unless they are permanently attached to the seabed. Compare

(5th Cir. 2014), with Scroggs v. Bis Salamis, Inc., No. 09-1007, 2010 WL 3910563 (E.D. Tex.
2010) (holding that floating production semi-submersible that was permanently moored to the
seabed through 16 chain mooring lines and that would cost $400 to $500 million to move was
not a vessel).23 In Offshore Co. v. Robison, 266 F.2d 769, 779 (5th Cir. 1959), the Fifth Circuit
held that a floating drilling platform is a vessel, despite the fact that it was not self-propelled and
that its primary purpose was to drill for oil.
More recently, in Demette v. Falcon Drilling Co, Inc., 280 F.3d 492, 498, n.18 (5th Cir.
2002), overruled on other grounds by Grand Isle Shipyard, Inc. v. Seacor Marine, LLC, 589 F.3d
778 (5th Cir. 2009), the Fifth Circuit found it “beyond dispute” that a jack-up rig was a vessel
under maritime law.24 Likewise, a district court recently found that the DEEPWATER
HORIZON, a semi-submersible, deep-water drilling platform was a vessel. In re Oil Spill by the
Oil Rig Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico, on Apr. 20, 2010, 808 F. Supp. 2d at 950; see
also Manuel v. P.A.W. Drilling & Well Serv., Inc., 135 F.3d 344, 348 (5th Cir. 1998) (“In a long
line of cases, we have held a variety of special purpose structures, far removed from the
conventional notion of ships and seagoing barges, to be vessels.”).

There is nothing that

substantively distinguishes the INNOVATOR from the numerous other semi-submersible rigs
that the Fifth Circuit has found to be vessels.

A jack-up rig has legs that can be lowered and secured to the seabed. Once the legs are secured, the rig is
“jacked-up” out of the water to create a drilling platform. The process is reversible, and a jack-up rig can be towed
to new sites. Id. at 495.

In In re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico, on Apr. 20,
2010, 808 F. Supp. 2d 943, 949 (E.D. La. 2011), aff’d sub nom. In re DEEPWATER HORIZON,
745 F.3d 157 (5th Cir. 2014), the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court’s finding that the
Mobile-Offshore-Drilling-Unit DEEPWATER HORIZON was a vessel. Although only one
party contested vessel status in that case, it is well-settled that parties cannot consent to subject
matter jurisdiction.25 As a result, the fact that the vast majority of the parties in the Deepwater
Horizon litigation agreed that the DEEPWATER HORIZON rig was a vessel is of no moment.
Moreover, although the Fifth Circuit did not discuss Lozman in the Deepwater Horizon
litigation, the Fifth Circuit’s lack of discussion of Lozman is readily explained by the fact that by
its own terms, Lozman was intended to apply to only “borderline cases” in which vessel status is
at issue. Lozman, 133 S. Ct. at 745. Semi-submersible rigs have never been “borderline cases.”
See BW Offshore USA, LLC, 145 F. Supp. at 662 (“Longstanding precedent in this circuit
establishes that mobile offshore drilling units are vessels under general maritime law.”) (citation
omitted).
The important takeaway from the Deepwater Horizon opinion is that it is a Fifth Circuit
decision post-Lozman which held that a MODU similar to the INNOVATOR was a vessel. In
fact, the MODU in the Deepwater Horizon matter was attached to the seabed by 5,000 feet of
pipe. The district court’s opinion stressed that the rig was mobile and that the Fifth Circuit has
consistently found mobile rigs like the DEEPWATER HORIZON to be vessels. 808 F. Supp. 2d
at 949-50 (citing Robinson, 266 F.2d at 779; Demette, 280 F.2d at 498 n.18; Stewart, 543 U.S. at
497). The DEEPWATER HORIZON rig had dynamic positioning capabilities that served the
same function as the INNOVATOR’s mooring on location, i.e. to ensure that the rig remained

See Simon v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 193 F.3d 848, 850 (5th Cir. 1999) (stating that “a party may neither

stationary during operations. See U.S. v. Transocean Deepwater Drilling, Inc., 767 F.3d 485,
491 (5th Cir. 2014) (holding that the DEEPWATER HORIZON was a “stationary source” when
on-site because the DEEPWATER HORIZON’s thrusters and propulsion capabilities were used
to hold the rig in place when on-site). Like the DEEPWATER HORIZON, the INNOVATOR is
also a mobile offshore unit and is marketed by Amerindo as being mobile. The fact that the
DEEPWATER HORIZON was found to be a vessel even when attached to the seabed further
supports the finding that the INNOVATOR, which is presently berthed a Gulf Marine’s facility,
is a vessel.
The recent case of Louisiana International Marine, L.L.C. v. The DRILLING RIG ATLAS
CENTURY26 is also instructive on the issue of vessel status in this case.

In Louisiana

International Marine, L.L.C., several parties asserted maritime lien claims against a semisubmersible drilling rig for the provision of various services, including towage of the rig as a
“wet tow.” The rig was seized, and the seizure was challenged on a motion to vacate the arrest
of the rig. Although the issue in Louisiana International Marine, L.L.C. was framed as whether
the rig was a “dead ship,” the case is instructive because it addressed whether a semi-submersible
similar in structure to the INNOVATOR was “practically capable of maritime transportation,” as
is required for a structure to be a vessel.27 The court cited to the fact that the rig was recently
towed as a “wet tow” as evidence that the rig was indeed practically capable of such maritime

26

See La. Int’l Marine, L.L.C. v. The DRILLING RIG ATLAS CENTURY, No. 11-186, 2012 WL 1029934
(S.D. Tex. Mar. 9, 2012), adopted La. Int’l Marine, L.L.C. v. The DRILLING RIG ATLAS CENTURY, No. 11-186,
2012 WL 1029703 (S.D. Tex. Mar. 26, 2012).
27
Unlike the INNOVATOR, the semi-submersible drilling rig in Louisiana International Marine, L.L.C.
had been cold-stacked for a decade and was partially dismantled with an equivocal intention to be scrapped.
Generators had been removed from the rig, and it lacked lifeboats, navigational aids, and operational bilge pumps.
It also was scheduled to undergo repairs before it could be placed back into operation. It had less vessel features
than the INNOVATOR, and yet was still determined to be a vessel. 2012 WL 1029934, at *7.

{N3438659.1}

18

Case 2:16-cv-00430 Document 64 Filed in TXSD on 07/26/17 Page 19 of 26

transportation. Based primarily on the recent towage of the rig as a “wet tow,” the court found
the rig to be “practically capable of maritime transportation” and thus a vessel. Id. at *7.
Similarly, in this case, the INNOVATOR was recently towed as a “wet tow” to Gulf
Marine’s dock. (Ladd Declaration, ¶ 9, Exh. 2). Like the rig in Louisiana International Marine,
L.L.C., the INNOVATOR also had line-handling crew and a pilot on board for portions of the
tow to Gulf Marine’s facility. (Id.). In addition, the INNOVATOR was recently moved and
shifted, using line-handling crew on board the semi-submersible and a pilot as well. (Id., ¶ 13).
Like the rig in Louisiana International Marine, L.L.C., the INNOVATOR was and is practically
capable of maritime transportation.
Moreover, the INNOVATOR is indisputably a semi-submersible with all of the hallmarks
of a vessel under established Fifth Circuit jurisprudence. She has a steel hull with twenty-five
(25) ballast tanks to insure its ability to float. (Id., ¶ 4). She has the typical semi-submersible
configuration with a watertight bulkhead and additional tanks for fuel, cement, water, and mud to
support her function as a mobile drilling vessel. (Id.). Moreover, the INNOVATOR has the
following objective vessel characteristics: Pontoon hull; Ballast tanks; Tow bridles; Towing lugs;
Fender frames; Navigational lights; Automated Identification System (AIS); Sleeping quarters
and accommodations for 98 people on board; Galley; Main Control Room; Lifeboats; Anchors;
Hull Positions System; Ballast System; GPS Positioning System; Draft marks; Anodes; Diesel
and gas turbine generators; Mooring system; and Winches. (Id., ¶ 6). Amerindo documented the
INNOVATOR with the National Vessel Documentation Center (See Exh. 3), and the
INNOVATOR is currently classed with the American Bureau of Shipping. (Ladd Declaration, ¶
9, Exh. 2). The United States Coast Guard inspected the INNOVATOR and issued a Certificate
of Inspection for the INNOVATOR.

{N3438659.1}

19

Case 2:16-cv-00430 Document 64 Filed in TXSD on 07/26/17 Page 20 of 26

If the INNOVATOR were found not to be a vessel, it is questionable whether any semisubmersible rig could qualify as a vessel under Lozman, which would abrogate decades of Fifth
Circuit jurisprudence. All semi-submersible rigs require the assistance of tugs to move long
distances and all semi-submersible rigs are attached to the seabed when on location. In addition,
semi-submersible rigs do not have a primary function of transporting people or cargo. Yet, even
with these characteristics, semi-submersible rigs like the INNOVATOR have always been
classified as vessels unless they are (1) permanently attached to the seabed and (2) require an
exorbitant cost to move to another location.
In its Motion to Dismiss, Amerindo cites to a list of nine (8) items as support for its
position on vessel-status. (R. Doc. 62, pp. 2-3). Four of the eight items relate to the lack of selfpropulsion (i.e. lack of engines, thrusters, automated positioning of thrusters, or steering
mechanism) and a fifth relates to the absence of a “raked bow.”28 (Id.). In Lozman, the Supreme
Court made clear that while lack of self-propulsion “may be a relevant factor” to consider in
determining vessel status, it “is not dispositive.” 133 S. Ct. at 741 (citing The Robert W.
Parsons, 191 U.S. 17, 31 (1903)). In Louisiana International Marine, L.L.C., the district court
found a semi-submersible rig to be a vessel despite the lack of self-propulsion, thrusters or
steering mechanism. 2012 WL 1029934, at *4, *7. Moreover, Amerindo’s reliance on lack of
self-propulsion ignores the plethora of objective vessel-characteristics cited above. Like the
dredge in Stewart, the INNOVATOR’s primary purpose is not navigation or commerce; yet, like
the dredge in Stewart, she has a hull, ballast tanks, navigational lights, crew quarters, and a
galley. (Ladd Declaration, ¶¶ 4-6, Exh. 2). Similar to the dredge in Stewart, the INNOVATOR
is a vessel.
28

The final three (3) items relate to the INNOVATOR’s design and intended use, and they are discussed

below.

{N3438659.1}

20

Case 2:16-cv-00430 Document 64 Filed in TXSD on 07/26/17 Page 21 of 26

Further, the Fifth Circuit has cautioned against rigid reliance on certain factors, including
certain items cited by Amerindo, to determine vessel status. Manuel, 135 F.3d at 351-52
(citation omitted). In Manuel, the Fifth Circuit found a floating workover rig to be a vessel,
stating that characteristics like a “raked bow” are not to be applied mathematically and are only
useful guides. Id. at 351-52 (citation omitted).29 Similarly, like the rig in Manuel and the rig in
Louisiana International Marine, L.L.C., the INNOVATOR is a vessel under the General
Maritime Law despite the absence of self-propulsion or a “rake bow.” As set forth herein, the
INNOVATOR is designed to be towed from site to site with equipment and crew. (Ladd
Declaration, ¶¶ 3-5, Exh. 2). As a semi-submersible, the INNOVATOR is not supported by
resting on the seabed. (Id., ¶ 3). Semi-submersible vessels like the INNOVATOR are able to
transform from a deep to a shallow draft by de-ballasting (removing ballast water from the hull),
thereby becoming surface vessels. (Id.). When the INNOVATOR was towed to Gulf Marine’s
facility, she was moved from location to location in this configuration. (Id., ¶¶ 5-6, 9). When
she will be towed to another site, she will also be moved in this configuration.

The

INNOVATOR is clearly capable of transporting crew and equipment over water sufficient to
qualify as a vessel for purposes of the CIMLA and General Maritime Law. Accordingly,
Amerindo’s Motion to Dismiss should be denied.

29
See also Pleason v. Gulfport Shipbuilding Corp., 221 F.2d 621, 623 (5th Cir. 1955) (“The ‘Carol Ann’
was an artificial contrivance capable of being used as a means of water transportation. It was afloat. Before repairs,
it was towed across the Gulf of Mexico; after repairs, it was towed from Port Arthur to Port Isabel, Texas. It had a
deck; it had cabins, it had superstructure. It had no motive power of its own; no steering mechanism; but it definitely
was capable of being used as a means of transportation under tow. Under the doctrine laid down in The Scorpio,
supra, and many other cases, it is plain to us that the ‘Carol Ann’ was a ‘vessel’ subject to a maritime lien,
enforceable by suit in rem.”).

4.

Amerindo Continues to Cite and Rely upon Cases Involving Permanently
Moored Structures That Were Practically Incapable of Maritime
Transportation and Thus Inapposite to the Temporarily Berthed
INNOVATOR

In its Motion to Dismiss, similar to its prior Motion to Vacate, Amerindo cites to several
cases in which courts have held that floating production platforms that were permanently
attached to the seabed were not vessels. The owners of the platforms in the cases cited by
Amerindo had no intention to move them and the cost to do so was exorbitantly expensive,
ranging from $42 million to $500 million. Several of the cases cited by Amerindo even involved
the same production facility, the THUNDER HORSE, which was permanently attached to the
seabed for the anticipated life of the facility and would cost $400-$500 million to move. The
THUNDER HORSE stands in stark contrast to the INNOVATOR, which was recently towed to
Gulf Marine’s dock as a wet tow with crew and pilot on board and was recently moved with the
assistance of the INNOVATOR’s crew and a pilot on board.
Despite the fact that the INNOVATOR was never permanently attached to the seabed at
any time that Gulf Marine provided necessaries to the vessel,30 Amerindo argues that the
INNOVATOR’s design and future at a job-site “for a number of years” make her similar to the
structures that are permanently attached to the seabed. In Louisiana International Marine,
L.L.C., supra, the district court addressed the same line of cases relied upon by Amerindo in its
motion to vacate. The district court expressly rejected the applicability of various cases which
have held that certain floating structures were not vessels. The court stated: “In each of these

30
At Amerindo’s request, Gulf Marine temporarily ballasted down the INNOVATOR at the water’s bottom
at Gulf Marine’s dock during this year’s hurricane season to provide further safety and security with respect to a
potential breakaway of the INNOVATOR. (Ladd Declaration, ¶ 14, Exh. 2). Previously, when afloat, the hull
ballast system was adjusted on a weekly basis to maintain level and/or draft. (Id.). The need to submerge the
INNOVATOR during hurricane season further demonstrates the practical capability of the INNOVATOR to
perform maritime transportation, both with respect to the INNOVATOR’s capability to ballast down as necessary
and with respect to the INNOVATOR’s threatened movement over navigable water during heavy weather.

{N3438659.1}

22

Case 2:16-cv-00430 Document 64 Filed in TXSD on 07/26/17 Page 23 of 26

cases, however, it was determined that the fact that the structures at issue were permanently
moored to the ocean floor rendered them practically incapable of maritime transportation by the
time of the incidents giving rise to the respective causes of action.” Id. at *7 (emphasis in
original). As a result, the court found the cases to be “readily distinguishable.”
Likewise, the cases relied upon by Amerindo are “readily distinguishable” from the
INNOVATOR, which is not attached to the seabed and instead is berthed at Gulf Marine’s dock
where she was towed as a wet tow and has remained berthed since Amerindo entered into the
2015 Layberth Agreement.

Amerindo’s allegations regarding the intended use of the

INNOVATOR at an unknown location in the future for a “number of years” is simply theoretical
and is refuted by the recent towage of the INNOVATOR to Gulf Marine’s dock, the continued
dockage at Gulf Marine’s facility, and the intent of Amerindo to tow the INNOVATOR a
substantial distance over navigable waters to work abroad.
The Fifth Circuit has recognized that a vessel owner’s intent may play a significant role
in determining whether a structure was “permanently moored” and therefore not practically
capable of use as a means of transportation on water. See De La Rosa v. St. Charles Gaming
Co., 474 F.3d 185, 187 (5th Cir. 2006).

Under the law, Amerindo’s intent to move the

INNOVATOR in the near future directly refutes Amerindo’s reliance on cases involving
permanently moored structures because Amerindo’s intent is evidence that the INNOVATOR is
not permanently moored, thus distinguishing the cases relied upon by Amerindo.
Finally, as shown from the brief descriptions of the cases cited by Amerindo, they are
inapposite to and easily distinguishable from the INNOVATOR:31

31

In addition to citing to cases involving floating production platforms permanently attached to the seabed,
Amerindo also erroneously relies on two cases involving permanently moored barges serving as floating hotels. See
Martin v. Fab-Con, Inc., 9 F. Supp. 3d 642, 644-45 (E.D. La. 2014) (involving personal injury on quartersbarge
used as floating hotel and spudded in place at a job site); Higginbotham v. Drake Towing, L.L.C., 2016 A.M.C. 227,
