PLAINTIFFS' MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF THEIR
MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL AND/OR TO ALTER OR AMEND THE JUDGMENT

In support of Plaintiffs' motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 59(a) and/or to alter or amend the judgment against them pursuant to Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 59(e) regarding their claims against Joseph R. Francis (``Francis"), Plaintiffs
state:

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

The judgment entered in favor of Francis is fatally flawed, requiring a new trial. Many
factors made it impossible for this jury to render a reasoned verdict: Francis' disruptive
behavior; the de facto admission of unauthenticated medical records; and a closing geared to
stigmatize these plaintiffs, eliciting the "slut" stereotype that painted these girls as "other," a
category of persons so fundamentally damaged that they could not be damaged further. This
made it impossible for the jury to ignore the issue of consent as this Court directed the jury to do

and as the law requires. In this stereotype, the "slut" has already consented, she cannot not

DM1\2626709.2
Case 5:08-cv-00079-RS -GRJ Document 625 Filed 05/09/11 Page 2 of 26

consent, and a pornographer simply reveals her "true" nature, no matter how young she is; 17,
16, 15, or 13. As counsel argued to the jury in closing, "[t]hese aren't innocent girls who aren't
somewhat familiar with what goes on on spring break ... It is a moral cesspool at spring break in
Panama City Beach ... And these girls knew exactly what went on at spring break. And their
parents knew what went on at spring break." Exh. 1, April 5, 2011 T.Tr. at 16.'

Counsel's use of the "slut" stereotype explains the internal inconsistency in the verdict.
The jury found that Francis engaged in "behavior that goes beyond all decency and is regarded as
shocking, atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community" when he filmed and
featured these minors in his pornographic production, but somehow found that "shocking,
atrocious, and utterly intolerable" behavior caused these girls no damage. The jury found that
Francis engaged in this pattern of criminal activity by exploiting Plaintiffs B and V, but again,
found a pattern of criminal exploitation caused them no damage. No matter what Francis did to
these girls, once they were painted as "sluts," Francis could not damage them.

On a motion for a new trial, the judge determines if the verdict is against the great weight
of the evidence or will result in the miscarriage of justice. Once the stereotypes are put to one
side, when the actual evidence on the record is considered, the great weight of the evidence does
not support this verdict. This verdict is a miscarriage of justice; it finds that a pornographer can
exploit teenage girls without damaging them, which declares "open season" on teenage girls and
invites their sexual exploitation by adult men. This record requires this Court to grant Plaintiffs

a new trial.

 

Certain of the trial transcripts ("T.Tr.") received from the court reporter lacked
pagination. Plaintiffs have inserted pagination where it was otherwise absent.

FACTS
A. Francis and the Corporations Repeatedly Disobey Court Orders

During pretrial phase, Francis continued to use the obstreperous tactics he employed
during discovery. First, the Corporations were defaulted for violating five Court orders requiring
that they obtain counsel by a date certain. Dkt. 559. No Defendant complied with any of the
Court's pretrial orders. Defendants had no witness list and no documents they could use at trial.
Francis did not show up to the pretrial conference, violating yet another set of Court orders.
Although it could have, the Court did not default Francis.

On the first day of trial, Francis finally came to the courthouse-two and one-half hours
late. Francis had retained counsel to represent him just for that day. This attorney was the sixth
attorney who appeared in the case. The entire first day of trial was wasted while Francis decided
if he wanted to pay this counsel; Francis eventually decided not to pay counsel, and proceeded
pro se.

An additional pretrial was then required. There were multiple problems created by
Francis proceeding pro se; he was not aware or did not care to respect any of the pretrial rulings
of the Court. When Francis told this Court that he planned to cross-examine Plaintiffs by asking
them irrelevant questions that violated Federal Rule of Evidence 412, another conference became
necessary. To stress the seriousness of its ruling, this Court ruled that anyone who violated Rule
412 would be immediately taken into custody.

B. Pro Se Francis Makes A Mockery Of The T rial

Since Francis refused to hire counsel, the trial began with Francis representing himself,
assisted by a former reporter who identified himself as Francis' "handler," and trailed by a
cameraman for a reality show about the trial. Francis immediately starting delivering unsworn

testimony to the potential jury during voir dire. Francis interrupted Plaintiffs' counsel several

3

DM1\2626709.2
Case 5:08-cv-00079-RS -GRJ Document 625 _ Filed 05/09/11 Page 4 of 26

times during voir dire, shouting out from counsel table claiming that he was not able to hear,
snorting, and distracting counsel, the potential jurors, and the Court.

When it was Francis' turn to question the jury, Francis lied about proceeding pro se,
claiming that his attorney's father had died and therefore could not attend, but Francis did not
want to waste the community's time so he was proceeding pro se; he began to tell the jury that
he could not afford an attorney (this continued until his seventh counsel appeared), He
repeatedly told the jury that this was the first trial that he had ever done, that he was defending
himself, and that he was struggling to do his best.

During his opening statement, while Francis was receiving multiple reprimands from the
Court for making inappropriate comments, he continued to try and garner sympathy from the
jury, saying that he could not afford counsel, that his counsel's father died, etc. As this Court
well knows, Francis is a multimillionaire who certainly has the means to retain counsel, and
several attorneys were willing to represent Francis. All of these comments were calculated to
invoke the jury's sympathy, Although Plaintiffs' counsel objected and the Court instructed
Francis to behave, Francis' antics continued.

Francis continued to testify -although never under oath-until he left the courtroom.
Most egregiously, during the side bars Francis refused to lower his voice. Everything said
during the side bars was heard by the jury and everyone in the courtroom. On more than one
occasion, people seated in the back of the courtroom informed counsel and the Court that they
heard every word of the sidebars. During one of the side bars while Plaintiff B was testifying,
Francis shouted that Plaintiffs B is a porn star. Francis shouted repeatedly during side bars that
the Plaintiffs lied about their age (and the films would show it!), they had signed releases, and

that they showed fake identification. Francis also loudly complained (for everyone to hear) that

DM1\2626709,2
Case 5:08-cv-00079-RS -GRJ Document 625 Filed 05/09/11 Page 5 of 26

the Court was unfair to him. Francis loudly disputed facts that were established under collateral
estoppel by his criminal pleas; he shouted that Plaintiff B was not identified in the criminal pleas,
and that the other Plaintiffs had nothing to do with the criminal pleas. No matter how many
warnings Francis received, or how many times he was given a final warning by this Court,
Francis chose not to keep his voice down.

Ata certain point, Francis took out what he said was a copy of the false identification that
he claimed the Plaintiffs had provided and waived it around the courtroom with the jury present.
It could not have been actual evidence of false identification; these Plaintiffs had no false
identification; no false identification was produced to the Plaintiffs during discovery; and the
FBI never found any in their investigation. Francis had told the Court he had some false
identification, the Court ordered Francis to produce it, and said it would have a hearing on its
admissibility. Instead of following the Court's orders and producing this so-called fake I.D.,
Francis waived what he said was a copy of some fake identification around the Courtroom in
front of the jury. Plaintiffs' counsel was never given whatever Francis waived around the
courtroom-Francis did not try to put this manufactured "false identification" into evidence or
produce it to the Court for a hearing. The damage had already been done-he was able to show
the jury what he claimed was fake identification without having to prove it.

While he was not testifying at the side bar, Francis was distracting the jury. While
Plaintiffs' witnesses testified, Francis made comments, faces, loudly ripped up paper, and did
everything that he could possibly think of to distract the jury. He made speeches during his
objections (ignoring numerous instructions from the Court to state only the grounds), resulting in
side bars where he continued to testify. During his cross-examination of Plaintiffs' witnesses, he

made comments that certain testimony was not true, made faces, and behaved in a manner utterly

DM1\2626709,2
Case 5:08-cv-00079-RS -GRJ Document 625 Filed 05/09/11 Page 6 of 26

inappropriate for any forum, let alone a federal court. Plaintiffs' counsel was forced to
constantly object throughout his cross-examination, and frequently move to strike his comments,
which served to further distract the jury, waste time, and make the testimony disjointed.

While Francis showed no respect for this Court, the Court bent over backwards to try and
accommodate Francis as a pro se defendant. Francis was given chance after chance to behave.
Although Francis had no good excuse for not having a qualified attorney present to represent
him, this Court never required that Francis know the rules of evidence or proceed like an
attorney. The only requirement was that Francis act like an adult-which at 38 years old, he
should be expected to do. On more than one occasion, for the whole courtroom to hear, Francis
loudly begged the Court for mercy during side bars, crying and shouting that he suffers from
ADHD, to garner additional sympathy from the jury. Ironically, while Francis was telling the
jury it should hold the 13, 15, 16, and 17 year old children personally responsible for being
victimized by an adult man (Francis) and his sophisticated Corporations, as a 38 year old man, he
expected this Court to understand his weaknesses and treat him accordingly.

C. Francis And The Corporations Found Guilty Of Acts Plaintiffs Allege.

While Francis was trying his best to make a mockery of the trial, Plaintiffs put on their
case. Plaintiffs began by reading Francis and the Corporations' federal criminal pleas and the
deferred prosecution agreement (`the Pleas") to the jury. See Plaintiffs' Trial Exhs. 1-2 and 5.
Francis' pleas established that he was involved in all major decisions on behalf of the company
for the 2002-2003 period; that when Plaintiff B was filmed, the cameraman was acting on his
behalf (and that of the Corporations); that the footage of Plaintiff B was included in two titles;
that Francis was involved personally in selecting the footage for these titles; and that he
knowingly decided to include footage of Plaintiff B when he did not have any records to show

that she was over 18. Plaintiffs' Trial Exh. 1, pp. 5-7, para. 9 (a)-(e).

6

DM1\2626709.2
Case 5:08-cv-00079-RS -GRJ Document 625 _ Filed 05/09/11 Page 7 of 26

Mantra's plea established that during 2002 and part of 2003, Mantra did not verify the
age of the people in the GGW series; it was the practice of Mantra during that time not to create
and maintain records that could determine the age of the girls in the series. Plaintiffs' Trial Exh.
2, p. 12,93. The deferred prosecution agreement for MRA incorporated these same admissions.
Plaintiffs' Trial Exh. 5, p. 13. All the Pleas attached a list of approximately 175 titles, for which
all of these Defendants admitted they did not have any records to demonstrate that anyone in any
of the films was actually over age 18. Plaintiffs' Trial Exh., 1 pp. 19-20; Plaintiffs' Trial Exh. 2,
pp. 15-16. One of these titles featured Plaintiffs J and S at 13 and 15 years old. Plaintiffs' Trial
Exh. 1, pp. 19-20; Plaintiffs' Trial Exh. 2, pp. 15-16. The criminal pleas also contained a $2.1
million fine that Francis and the Corporations paid during the federal criminal proceedings.

For Plaintiff V, Francis was convicted in state criminal proceeding for procuring her, as a
minor, into prostitution, when he coerced her to masturbate him. Plaintiffs submitted this into
evidence in the form of a statement that was published to the jury. Plaintiffs' Trial Exh. 109.

D. The Plaintiffs, Their Mothers, And A Friend Explain How GGW Destroyed
Their Lives

Plaintiffs testified extensively as to how their lives fell apart after GGW featured them in
its series, how their communities branded them as "sluts" and "whores," and how they were cast
out of their communities. Plaintiff B testified about how she dropped out of college and began a
downward spiral, resulting in a nervous breakdown and three different hospitalizations after the
film in which GGW placed her was released; her mother and her former boyfriend corroborated
her testimony.

Plaintiffs J and S testified that when their community discovered they were featured in
the GGW series at 13 and 15, they were branded as "sluts" and "whores," all their friends

refused to associate with them, and their breasts and butts were grabbed daily as they walked

DM1\2626709.2
Case 5:08-cv-00079-RS -GRJ Document 625 _ Filed 05/09/11 Page 8 of 26

through the halls of their high school; Plaintiff J and S dropped out of school; Plaintiff J testified
to her suicide attempts; Plaintiff S to her downward spiral ending in a very abusive relationship.
Plaintiff J and S' mother corroborated their testimony.

Plaintiff V testified to being forced to masturbate Francis, for which he was criminally
convicted, and that she was coerced into flashing for the GGW series. She testified that it caused
her boyfriend to break up with her, and played a pivotal role in her subsequent suicide attempt.
She testified that her mother's death and her abusive father made her vulnerable to being taken
advantage of as a 16 year old by Francis.

E. Francis Retains Counsel

Francis' foray into the legal profession ended after the cross-examination of Plaintiff V,
when this Court held Francis in contempt for violating its orders. Francis began his cross-
examination of Plaintiff V by telling the court (and of course the jury) that Plaintiffs' counsel
was telling Plaintiff V what to say (which was not true). Francis' cross-examination of Plaintiff
V ended with Francis deliberately violating Rule 412 when he asked her if she is a prostitute.
This Court was very clear in its ruling that anyone in violation of Rule 412 would be taken into
custody-the Court did not take Francis into custody as it could have under its previous order,
but gave Francis another chance, only assessing a monetary fine of $2,500. After days of
prejudicing the jury by telling them repeatedly that he could not afford to retain counsel, that he
had never done this before, and he was doing his best under the circumstances, within a matter of
hours, Francis was able to find funds to pay his contempt fine and two attorneys who were ready
to jump in and represent him.

With the appearance of Francis' counsel, the trial started to move along in a more orderly
fashion. However, at this point, Francis' antics in combination with his failure to identify
witnesses or documents to defend himself had set the stage for what was to come.

F. As Adolescents, Plaintiffs Were Vulnerable

Dr. Costanzo, an expert in adolescence, testified about adolescence in general. He
testified as to the development of the adolescent brain, explaining to the jury that a certain
portion of the brain, the cerebral cortex, is not fully developed until a person's early to middle
twenties. It is that portion of the brain that allows a person to understand and appreciate the
consequences of her acts. He explained that because of this, adolescents are at a very vulnerable
stage of their lives, where they are susceptible to peer pressure and to coercion. He explained
that adolescents are very present focused, meaning they live in the moment and do not consider
the consequences of their acts. Dr. Costanzo testified that the reason that our society has laws
that protect minors is because we recognize that they are biologically vulnerable and we as a
society seek to protect them from making choices that they will later regret.

G. GGW Psychologically Harmed The Plaintiffs

Dr. Lebowitz testified that all of the Plaintiffs were harmed by GGW. GGW began a
downward spiral that radically destabilized each as follows: Plaintiff B had a nervous
breakdown that ended with three hospitalizations; Plaintiff J attempted suicide twice and entered
an abusive relationship; Plaintiff S entered a very violent relationship; and Plaintiff V attempted
suicide. Exh. 2, April 1, 2011 T.Tr. at 17, 56-57, 65, 84-85. Dr. Lebowitz testified that to come
to her conclusion she used a peer reviewed method which consisted of extensive clinical
interviews of Plaintiffs and a relative when available. /d. at 7-8. Dr. Lebowitz also relied on a
test given to the Plaintiffs by defense expert, who was not present at the trial, that demonstrated
the Plaintiffs were not liars, and were not "gold diggers" or had a profile of people that were just
suing for money. /d, at 10-11.

On cross-examination, Francis' counsel made the cornerstone of Francis' defense

causation-the argument, that being featured in GGW as minors did not cause their damage.

Case 5:08-cv-00079-RS -GRJ Document 625 _ Filed 05/09/11 Page 10 of 26

With no expert witness of his own to put on the stand, Francis' counsel tried to get the opinions
of other medical professionals into evidence through Dr. Lebowitz. Under the guise of trying to
challenge Dr. Lebowitz, Francis' counsel put into the record, sometimes by literally reading the
medical records, the conclusions of other medical professionals. Exh. 2 at 96-99, 101-110
(Plaintiff B); id. at 112-116 (Plaintiff V); id. at 117-122, 125-127, 129, 132-33 (Plaintiff J), id. at
143 (Plaintiff S).

Counsel began her cross-examination telling the jury, "[t]hen let's talk about what you
did not mention to the jury when you reviewed their medical documentation." Exh. 2 at 96,
Counsel recited the diagnoses of other medical professionals into evidence under the guise of
cross-examination, id. at 96, and went so far as to ask Dr. Lebowitz if she had conferred with the
medical professionals that treated the plaintiffs, as if the conclusions of these other medical
professionals were properly in evidence and could serve as a counterpoint to Dr. Lebowitz's
opinion. Jd. at 107.

What was not in the medical records was just as important for Francis' counsel. Counsel
questioned Dr. Lebowitz extensively about the fact that GGW did not appear in these medical
records. Exh. 2 at 103 ("Q. [S]he was speaking with numerous licensed professionals, I'm sure,
doctors, and perhaps not of your caliber, but certainly licensed medical professionals capable of
making these sorts of determinations. And anywhere in those doctors' notes did she indicate
anything about Girls Gone Wild, or any sort of trauma related to Girls Gone Wild or Joe
Francis?" ... A. No, I agree with you. People don't talk about what they're ashamed of. Q.
Right. Not until they're suing someone."); id. at 113 ("She didn't mention anything there about
this incident with Girls Gone Wild either?"); id. at 119 ("And in that particular case, while she

was under the care of her doctors, she didn't mention anything about Girls Gone Wild, did
