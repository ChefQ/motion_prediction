No. 03-2670C
(Senior Judge Margolis)

DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO FILE MOTION TO COMPEL RCFC 30(b)(6)
TESTIMONY UNDER SEAL, AND REQUEST FOR EXPEDITED CONSIDERATION
Pursuant to Rule 7 of the Court's Rules ("RCFC") and General
Order 47A Â¶ I.7 (Nov. 4, 2004), defendant, the United States,
respectfully requests leave of the Court to file a motion and
attachments under seal.

That motion will request the Court to

overrule the objections of plaintiff, Huntleigh USA Corporation,
to providing testimony of a corporate representative concerning
two topics identified in a deposition notice served by defendant
on December 1, 2005, pursuant to RCFC 30(b)(6).

Undersigned

counsel and counsel for Huntleigh conferred in writing regarding
the discovery dispute on December 9 and 15, 2005.
Because the parties have agreed, pursuant to RCFC 29, to
conduct their respective RCFC 30(b)(6) depositions in early
January 2006, which is after the scheduled close of factual
discovery on December 15, 2005 and during the period scheduled
for expert discovery; but the parties do not wish to extend the
overall discovery period; we respectfully request the Court to
grant this motion in an expedited fashion.

We will, for the same

reasons, request expedited consideration of our motion to compel
RCFC 30(b)(6) testimony.
The parties disagree as to whether Huntleigh should be
required to provide the testimony of a corporate representative
concerning two categories of expenses that are noted in
Huntleigh's financial statements for calendar and fiscal year
2002.

The documents produced by Huntleigh in discovery that

refer to the nature and amounts of those expenses are marked
confidential.

Because we cannot fairly explain the grounds for

compelling the testimony without describing the expenses at
issue, paragraph 10 of the protective order entered on December
14, 2005 requires us to file our motion to compel under seal.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, the Government respectfully
requests expedited consideration of this motion and leave to file
a motion to compel RCFC 30(b)(6) testimony under seal.
Respectfully submitted,
PETER D. KEISLER
Assistant Attorney General
