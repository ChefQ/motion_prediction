TO ALL PARTIES AND THEIR ATTORNEYS OF RECORD:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that on February 27, 2009, at 9:00 a.m., or as soon thereafter as

the matter may be heard in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California,
Plaintiffs Google Inc., AOL LLC, Yahoo! Inc., IAC Search & Media, Inc., and Lycos, Inc. will

8

and hereby do move this Court pursuant to Local Rule 7-2 and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37
for an order granting Plaintiffs’ Cross-Motion to Compel Production of Documents from

9 Defendant Software Rights Archive, LLC. Plaintiffs’ motion is based on this Notice of Motion
10 and Motion, the accompanying Memorandum of Points and Authorities, the pleadings and other
11 papers on file in this action, and such further evidence and argument as may be presented at or
12

before the hearing on this matter.

13
MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
14
Preliminary Statement
15
Plaintiffs, Google Inc., AOL LLC, Yahoo! Inc., IAC Search & Media, Inc., and Lycos,
16
17

Inc., respectfully ask this Court to DENY Defendants’ Motion to Quash Plaintiffs’ 30(b)(6) Notice

18 of Deposition of Defendant Software Rights Archive, LLC (“SRA”). (Docket No. 63). The
19 Plaintiffs seek to depose a corporate representative of SRA on jurisdictional issues related to
20 SRA’s motion to dismiss, transfer, or stay this action. (Docket No. 42). SRA has failed to
21 establish “good cause” to prevent Plaintiffs from obtaining this highly relevant and otherwise
22

discoverable information. Moreover, SRA’s refusal to provide a witness unless and until the

23
Plaintiffs disclose their theory of jurisdiction is a transparent attempt to invade the Plaintiffs’ work
24
25
26

product. The Motion to Quash should therefore be denied.
Plaintiffs also cross-move to compel SRA to produce documents that are necessary for

27 Plaintiffs to fully oppose SRA’s motion to dismiss, transfer, or stay. On November 21, 2008 and

51429/2782020.2

28 December 12, 2008, respectively, Plaintiffs served their First and Second Set of Requests for

1 Production on SRA, which sought documents relating to SRA’s contacts with California and the
2 California contacts of its closely-related parent companies and possible alter egos, SRA, LLC and

4

Altitude Capital Partners, L.P. SRA refused to produce any documents regarding jurisdiction in
response to Plaintiffs’ requests, although such documents are clearly discoverable under Rule

5
6
7

26(b)(1) because they are reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence regarding personal
jurisdiction over SRA. Accordingly, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court GRANT their

8 cross-motion to compel SRA to produce documents responsive to each request in Plaintiffs’ First
9 and Second Set of Requests for Production.
10

Statement of Facts

11 I.

Background

12

This is a declaratory judgment action regarding three United States patents. Among other

13

things, Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that Defendants SRA and Daniel Egger do not own

14
such patents. On November 10, 2008, the Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, transfer, or stay
15
16

this action. In the motion, SRA contends that it is not subject to personal jurisdiction in this Court.

17

A.

Plaintiffs’ Notice of 30(b)(6) Deposition

18

Plaintiffs’ Notice of Deposition to SRA Pursuant to Rule 30(b)(6) (dated December 22,

19 2008, attached as Exhibit A, and hereinafter “Notice”) seeks information related to Plaintiffs’
20 opposition to Defendants’ motion to dismiss. Defendant SRA’s refusal to produce a witness is
21 without merit and significantly prejudices Plaintiffs in their opposition to Defendants’ motion to
22

dismiss (presently due February 6, 2009). SRA has no legitimate basis to refuse to provide a

23
witness and, therefore, Plaintiffs respectfully ask that this Court deny SRA’s Motion to Quash,
24
25

order SRA to produce a witness on the topics in Plaintiffs’ Notice within 10 days of the Court’s

26 Order, and allow Plaintiffs the opportunity to submit supplemental briefing on Defendants’ motion
27 to transfer, dismiss, or stay within 10 days of the deposition.

B.

2

On November 21, 2008 and December 12, 2008, respectively, Plaintiffs served their first

Plaintiffs’ Request for Production of Documents to SRA

3 and second set of requests for production on SRA.1 On December 9, 2008 and January 15, 2009,
4
5

respectively, SRA filed its objections and responses, wherein SRA refused to produce a single
document.2 Instead, SRA generally objected that Plaintiffs’ document requests were “irrelevant to

6
7
8

personal jurisdiction.” SRA objected to the following categories of requests as irrelevant to
personal jurisdiction. First, SRA objected to requests that sought documents identifying SRA’s

3
9 directors, owners, and persons having a beneficial interest in SRA’s patent infringement lawsuit.

10 Second, SRA objected to every document request that sought information about SRA, LLC,
11 including requests that expressly sought documents relating to SRA, LLC’s contacts with
12
13

California or California citizens.4

Third, SRA objected to a request that sought documents

relating to SRA’s relationship with Altitude Capital Partners, L.P.,5 an investment firm that, upon

14
15

information and belief, controls both SRA and SRA, LLC.
On January 22, 2009, Plaintiffs sent SRA a letter explaining that these document requests

16

17 are relevant to establish personal jurisdiction over SRA, and emphasizing SRA’s duty to respond
18 to these requests under Rule 26(b)(1).6 On January 29, 2009, SRA sent a response letter claiming,
19 inter alia, that “the demands for documents from SRA, LLC . . . have nothing to do with
20

California personal jurisdiction [over SRA].”7 SRA also argued that documents relating to SRA’s

SRA also refused to disclose whether it is in possession of documents responsive to such

5
Argument

6
7

I.

SRA cannot show that relief from Plaintiffs’ Notice is warranted. Federal Rule of Civil

8
9

SRA’s Motion To Quash Should Be Denied

Procedure 26(c) requires a showing of “good cause” before a court will quash a deposition

10 “to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression or undue burden or
11 expense.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c). It is well-settled that a strong showing of “good cause” is
12 required “before a party will be denied entirely the right to take a deposition.” See Blankenship v.
13

Hearst Corp., 519 F.2d 418, 429 (9th Cir. 1975). Indeed, “[f]or good cause to exist, the party

14
seeking protection bears the burden of showing specific prejudice or harm will result if no
15
16

protective order is granted.” Excelligence Learning Corp. v. Oriental Trading Co., Inc., No. 5:03-

17 CV-4947, 2004 WL 2452834 (N.D. Cal. June 4, 2004); see also Beckman Indus., Inc. v. Int’l Ins.
18 Co., 966 F.2d 470, 476 (9th Cir. 1992) (“Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific
19 examples or articulated reasoning, do not satisfy the Rule 26(c) test.”). As demonstrated below,
20 SRA has failed to establish “good cause.”

22

Plaintiffs’ 30(b)(6) Notice Seeks Information Necessary To Respond To SRA’s
Objection To Personal Jurisdiction Before This Court

Plaintiffs’ Notice seeks information in three specific categories, each of which is directly

23

24 related to Plaintiffs’ opposition to SRA’s contention that it is not subject to personal jurisdiction in
25 this Court. First, Plaintiffs’ Notice includes topics regarding SRA’s relationship with “SRA,

1 LLC,” Altitude Capital Partners, L.P., Daniel Egger, and any beneficiaries that have an interest in
2 SRA or its present litigation against Plaintiffs in Texas.9 See, e.g., Notice, at Topics 1–4, 10.
3
4

SRA appears to be a patent holding company with no present business but litigating three United
States patents. SRA’s corporate parent is “SRA, LLC,” a Delaware-based company that appears

5
6
7

to have no present business except that it is a holding company of a patent-holding company. On
information and belief, both SRA and SRA, LLC are controlled and owned by Altitude Capital, an

10
8 investment firm that uses nonpracticing entities to bring patent infringement lawsuits. Plaintiffs

9 are entitled to explore the relationship between SRA and these other entities.11 Indeed, if SRA and
10 “SRA, LLC” are mere shells to shield Altitude Capital from this Court’s jurisdiction, then Altitude
11

Capital’s contacts with this forum are highly relevant to the issue of personal jurisdiction. SRA

12
cannot be permitted to hide within this babushka-doll-like structure to avoid litigating in a forum
13
14

where its actual controlling members have contacts with the state. See, e.g., Taurus IP, LLC v.

15 DaimlerChrysler Corp., 519 F. Supp. 2d 905, 917–23 (W.D. Wisc. 2007) (holding that a patent
16 holding company was subject to personal jurisdiction in a forum where its parent and managing
17 member had contacts with the state); Mathes v. Nat’l Utility Helicopters Ltd., 68 Cal. App. 3d 182,
18
19

9

Defendant SRA filed suit against Google Inc., AOL LLC, Yahoo! Inc., IAC Search & Media,
Inc., and Lycos, Inc. in federal court in Texas. See Case No. 2:07-cv-511 (CE) (hereinafter,
the “Texas Action”).

10

For instance, SRA shares an address -- 485 Madison Ave., New York, NY, 10022 -- with
Altitude Capital. SRA also identified Russ Barron as “in-house counsel” in motion practice in
the Texas Action on the scope of the protective order. See Joint Motion of the Parties to
Notify the Court of (1) Agreements Regarding Protective Order and (2) One Remaining
Dispute Regarding Protective Order (Docket No. 99 in the Texas Action), Kash Decl. Ex. F at
3. Mr. Barron is a consultant or advisor to Altitude Capital. Id. at 7. Moreover, Altitude
Capital appears to engage in regular business in California. See, e.g., http://www.visto.com/
news/releases/pdfs/07.02.16_financing.pdf (disclosing an alleged $35M investment in a
California corporation), Kash Decl. Ex. G.

11

Plaintiffs have also served a subpoena on “SRA, LLC” on November 25, 2008, for documents
relating to these issues. “SRA, LLC” refused to produce any documents.

Second, Plaintiffs’ Notice includes topics regarding SRA’s contacts with California—
topics undoubtedly relevant to personal jurisdiction in this district.

See, e.g., Breckenridge

5
6
7

Pharm., Inc. v. Metabolite Labs., Inc., 443 F.3d 1356, 1361–62 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Specifically,
Plaintiffs’ Deposition Notice includes topics regarding SRA’s contacts with California, including

8 SRA’s efforts to solicit or acquire funds; SRA’s business activities in California; its contracts with
9 California; and any communications with persons or businesses in California. See, e.g., Notice, at
10 Topic Nos. 5–9. SRA claims it has done nothing but acquire the patents in February 2005 and file
11

the Texas lawsuit against Plaintiffs in November 2007. Defendants’ Mt. to Dismiss, Transfer, or

12
Stay, at 10 (Docket No. 42). Plaintiffs are entitled to test and explore that self-serving statement.
13
14

For example, one area that is proper grounds for examination is whether any of the funds that are

15 being used to fund SRA’s litigations originated from investors in California.
Third, Plaintiffs’ Notice includes topics regarding SRA’s predecessor in interest—a

16

17 company called Software Rights Archive, Inc. that was formed by Daniel Egger in January 2004.
18 See, e.g., Notice, at Topic Nos. 11–17. SRA cannot avoid Software Rights Archive, Inc.’s
19

contacts with California simply by changing its corporate form. See, e.g., Minnesota Min. & Mfg.

20
Co. v. Eco Chem, Inc., 757 F.2d 1256, 1263 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (exercising jurisdiction over
21
22

successor corporation when it was a “mere continuation” of the predecessor). Software Rights

23 Archive, Inc., for instance, maintained an internet website at http://www.srarchive.com, which
24 presumably drew traffic from visitors located in California before its decommissioning in late
25 2005. Plaintiffs are entitled to explore Software Rights Archive, Inc.’s contacts with California as
26
27

well as the circumstances surrounding its change in corporate form to Software Rights Archive,
LLC.

1

In short, SRA’s motion to quash should be denied because Plaintiffs’ Notice seeks targeted

2 discovery on topics directly related to this Court’s jurisdiction over SRA.
3
4
5

B.

SRA Has No Legitimate Basis To Evade Plaintiffs’ 30(b)(6) Deposition Notice

SRA has no legitimate basis to refuse to produce a corporate representative for deposition.
First, SRA mischaracterizes the record when it contends that Plaintiffs have “admitted” that “SRA

6
7
8

has no contacts with California whatsoever.” Mt. to Quash, at 2. SRA relies on the following
statement: “As of November 21, 2007, Defendant SRA’s sole business activity has been to

9 prosecute an action against Plaintiffs for alleged infringement of the Patents-in-Suit.” Cmplt. for
10 Decl. Relief at ¶ 33 (Docket No. 1). But nothing in Plaintiffs’ statement, which has been neither
11 admitted or denied by SRA, precludes SRA from having significant contacts with California prior
12

to or subsequent to filing the Texas lawsuit (for instance, potentially acquiring funds from

13
California investors to acquire the patents and fund the litigation). And even if SRA has no
14
15

contacts with California, Plaintiffs are entitled to explore the relationship of SRA to its cascading

16 shells of entities and its predecessors, as well as those entities’ contacts with California, as
17 explained above.
18

Second, SRA complains that Plaintiffs have not provided sufficient “justification” for the

19 deposition. But there is no provision of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or this Court’s Local
20

Rules that requires Plaintiffs to hand over their legal theories, case strategy, deposition outline,

21
and exhibits in advance of the deposition. Indeed, SRA’s complaint is no different than asking
22
23

Plaintiffs for their protected attorney work product prior to the deposition. Plaintiffs provided

24 SRA with a deposition notice that included seventeen (17) topics, all of which relate to the issue of
25 personal jurisdiction; the rules require no more. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) (requiring the notice
26 to “describe with reasonable particularity the matters for examination”). Finally, there is no
27

reason that SRA’s corporate representative would be unduly burdened by having to investigate the

CASE NO. C-08-03172-RMW

7

1 noticed topics and testify on them.
2 II.

Plaintiffs’ Cross-Motion to Compel Production of Documents Should Be Granted

3

SRA cannot evade its obligation to provide documents that are relevant to testing the

4
5

merits of SRA’s motion to dismiss. Accordingly, the Court should compel SRA to produce
documents responsive to Plaintiffs’ First and Second Set of Requests for Production. The Federal

6
7
8

Rules authorize a party to seek documents “regarding any non-privileged matter that is relevant to
any party’s claim or defense.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1), 34(a). A party may move to compel

9 production of documents that were improperly withheld in response to a document request under
10 Rule 34. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(3)(B)(iv).
11
12

Here, SRA should produce documents responsive to Plaintiffs’ requests because such
documents are highly relevant to several issues raised in SRA’s motion to dismiss, such as

13
personal jurisdiction. Just to name three examples, Plaintiffs have requested “documents relating
14
15

to any contact by [SRA] or SRA, LLC with California of California law.”12 They have requested

16 “documents relating to any capital, equity, line of credit, of funds obtained from, or solicited from
13
17 persons located . . . in California.” And they have requested “documents sufficient to identify all

18 owners and/or beneficiaries having an interest in [SRA], including such persons having a
19 domicile, residence, or place of business in California.”14
20

Plaintiffs’ requests are relevant to establishing personal jurisdiction over SRA.

For

21
example, the document requests concerning the identify of SRA’s officers, controlling persons,
22
23

and individuals with a stake in SRA’s lawsuit are relevant to whether any of these individuals

1 reside in California or have reached into California for the benefit of SRA.15 If so, then SRA
2 could be subject to personal jurisdiction by virtue of these individuals’ actions on SRA’s behalf.
3
4

See Int’l. Shoe Co. v. Wash., 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945) (a corporation’s presence, for personal
jurisdiction purposes, is “manifested only by activities carried on in its behalf by those who are

5
6

authorized to act for it”).
Similarly, the document requests that seek information regarding SRA, LLC’s contacts

7

16
8 with California are also relevant to establishing personal jurisdiction over SRA. As discussed

9 above, the evidence available to date indicates that SRA and SRA, LLC are, on information and
10 belief, both shell companies that were established for the sole purpose of asserting the patents-in11

suit and do not transact any other business. Thus, for personal jurisdiction purposes, SRA and

12
SRA, LLC do not have distinct corporate identities, and the California contacts of one can be used
13
14

to establish personal jurisdiction over the other. See Howard v. Everex Sys., Inc., 228 F.3d 1057,

15 1069 n.17 (9th Cir. 2000) (“Although jurisdiction over a subsidiary does not automatically provide
16 jurisdiction over a parent, where the parent totally controls the actions of the subsidiary so that the
17 subsidiary is the mere alter ego of the parent, jurisdiction is appropriate over the parent as well.
18 Because it appears, at the pleading stage, that [the subsidiary] is merely a shell that is entirely
19

controlled by [the parent], we disregard [the subsidiary’s] separate identify for personal

20
jurisdiction purposes.”).
21
For similar reasons, Plaintiffs are entitled to seek documents regarding SRA’s relationship

22

23 with Altitude Capital – the ultimate entity that appears to control both SRA and SRA, LLC. If
24 Altitude Capital does indeed control SRA, then Altitude Capital’s contacts with California could
25 establish personal jurisdiction over SRA. See Taurus IP, 519 F. Supp. 2d at 917-23; Mathes, 68
26
27

15
16

28
51429/2782020.2

See id. at Requests for Production Nos. 8-10, 18, 22.
See Kash Decl. Ex. B at Requests for Production Nos. 1, 3, 5.

CASE NO. C-08-03172-RMW

9

1 Cal. App. 3d at 190. Therefore, for personal jurisdiction purposes, it is entirely proper to inquire
2 into SRA’s relationship with Altitude Capital, and SRA cannot claim that documents disclosing
3

this relationship are irrelevant to personal jurisdiction.

4
Conclusion
5

For these reasons, Defendant SRA’s motion to quash should be denied, and Plaintiffs’

6
7
8

cross-motion to compel production of documents should be granted, so that Plaintiffs can obtain
adequate jurisdictional discovery on SRA. Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court order

9 SRA to produce a corporate representative to testify on the topics in Plaintiffs’ Notice and to
10 produce documents responsive to each request in Plaintiffs’ First and Second Set of Requests for
11 Production. Plaintiffs further request that the Court provide Plaintiffs with 10 days after the date
12

of the 30(b)(6) deposition and receipt of the documents to allow Plaintiffs the opportunity to

13
submit supplemental briefing on Defendants’ motion to transfer, dismiss, or stay.
