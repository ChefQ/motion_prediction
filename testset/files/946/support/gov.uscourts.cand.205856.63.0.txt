duplicative of a first-filed case that Defendants filed in the Eastern District of Texas eight
months before Plaintiffs filed this case. See Software Rights Archive, LLC v. Google, Inc., et al,
Case No. 2:07-CV-511-TJW-CE, filed November 21, 2007. This case therefore should be
dismissed under the first-to-file rule. This Court also lacks subject matter jurisdiction over
Plaintiffs' claims against Site Technologies, Inc. and Daniel Egger, because neither of those
parties owns the patents-in-suit. Finally, this Court lacks personal jurisdiction over SRA and
Egger, because neither has established minimum contacts with California. Defendants have filed

a Motion to Dismiss, Transfer or Stay, which is set for hearing in this Court on February 27,

2009.

4. Plaintiffs' Rule 30(b)(6) notice also flies in the face of Rule 26. Rule 26 states:
"T]he court must limit the . . . extent of discovery . . . if it determines that . . . the burden or
expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit... ." Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2)(C).

The proposed deposition falls squarely within this rule. There is simply no benefit to be gained
from the proposed deposition of SRA. The issue pending before this Court, to which Plaintiffs'
deposition is purportedly directed, is whether SRA possesses sufficient contacts with California
to give rise to personal jurisdiction in this Court. But Plaintiffs have already admitted the simple
truth, which is that SRA has no contacts with California whatsoever. Plaintiffs have admitted
that SRA is neither incorporated nor based in California. (Compl. 0x00A7 8.) And Plaintiffs have
admitted that SRA has no business activities in California: "As of November 21, 2007,
Defendant SRA's sole business activity has been to prosecute an action [in Texas] against
Plaintiffs for alleged infringement of the Patents-in-Suit." (Compl. J 33.) In short, Plaintiffs'
own admissions reveal that their requested deposition will be useless-and that Plaintiffs know
it. The simple truth is that SRA had no contacts with California before it filed suit in Texas, and
any subsequent contacts occurred only in the course of pursuing the Texas action, and then only

because some of the infringing parties have California domiciles. Plaintiffs know all this.

 

By contrast, Defendants have not opposed Plaintiffs' request to depose Daniel Egger on his
contacts with California, although Defendants believe that deposition will confirm the lack of
minimum contacts sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over him.

5. Further, when Defendants requested some justification for this deposition,
Plaintiffs have failed to shed any light on what possible discovery purpose an SRA deposition
might serve. The undersigned defense counsel asked Plaintiffs' counsel in a telephone
conversation why Plaintiffs were seeking SRA's deposition. Plaintiffs' counsel identified no
basis for the deposition, but instead stated only that Plaintiffs had "a theory," the contents of
which they would not reveal until after the deposition of Daniel Egger (scheduled for January 27,
2009). This cryptic, and substantively empty, statement was then followed more recently by this
conclusory assertion in an email: "You have alleged that SRA has no contacts with California,
and we'd like to test that assertion." SRA has nothing to prove, and there is nothing to "test"
because Plaintiffs themselves know and have alleged from the start that SRA has no contacts
with California. If, as Plaintiffs allege, "SRA's sole business activity has been to prosecute an
action [in Texas] against Plaintiffs for alleged infringement" then one wonders what additional
"testing" of personal jurisdiction could be necessary.

6. In conclusion, the proposed deposition of SRA _ constitutes vexatious
multiplication of the proceedings and will serve no discovery purpose. Its non-existent benefits
are vastly outweighed by the burden and expense of making a witness available for a pointless

deposition. This Court should quash Plaintiffs' notice of deposition of SRA.
