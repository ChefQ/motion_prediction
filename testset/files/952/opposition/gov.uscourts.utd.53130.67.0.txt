DEFENDANTS’ RESPONSE TO
PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR
RECONSIDERATION OR IN THE
ALTERNATIVE RELIEF TO FILE A
SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT
Case No. 2:05CV00485
Judge Dee Benson

Defendants.
Plaintiffs have filed a Motion for Reconsideration and, alternatively, a Motion for Leave
to File a Second Amended Complaint. Both Motions are designed to accomplish the same thing
– overturning this Court’s ruling of November 28, 2007,1 and put all of the previously dismissed
Plaintiffs and causes of action back in the case.

1

All references herein to this Court’s “ruling,” “prior ruling,” “decision,” or “Opinion and Order” are to this
Court’s Opinion and Order of November 28, 2007.

Dockets.Justia.com

Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in Support of their motions assert that this Court erred in its
rulings dismissing certain Plaintiffs challenging Utah’s Harmful to Minors statute for lack of
standing. The allegations of error relate to Utah Code Ann. § 76-10-1205 (inducing acceptance
of pornographic material), § 1206 (dealing in material harmful to a minor), § 1231 (filtering). To
deny Plaintiffs’ Motion for Reconsideration and grant Plaintiffs’ Motion for Leave to File a
Second Amended Complaint is to essentially grant the Motion for Reconsideration. Either way,
Plaintiffs are attempting to get a second (or third) bite at the apple.

ISSUE

Six of fourteen Plaintiffs and two of four causes of action were dismissed from this case
by this Court’s Order of November 28, 2007. Plaintiffs now file a Motion for Reconsideration,
or in the alternative a Motion for Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint, for the purpose of
reinstating those six Plaintiffs and two causes of action. Should this Court now reverse its prior
Order, which addressed the same issues being presented by these two Motions, and grant either
Motion?

I. PROCEDURAL BASIS FOR DENYING THE MOTIONS
A.

Plaintiffs’ Motion for Reconsideration
Plaintiffs’ Motion for Reconsideration revisits the same issues already addressed and

dismissed by the Court. They assert the same issues they asserted in their original Memorandum
in Opposition to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, dated July 2, 2007, Docket No. 53.
2

It is not an appropriate use of a Motion to Reconsider “to revisit issues already addressed
or advance arguments that could have been raised in prior briefing.” Servants of Paraclete v.
Does, 204 F.3d 1005, 1012 (10th Cir. 2000), citing Van Skiver v. United States, 952 F.2d 1241,
1243 (10th Cir. 1991). “The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not recognize a ‘motion to
reconsider.’” Van Skiver, 952 F.2d at 1243. Advancing new arguments or supporting facts
which are otherwise available for presentation when the original motion was briefed is likewise
inappropriate. Id.
Based on the fact that there is no Motion for Reconsideration in the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, and the denial of the same by the Tenth Circuit, Plaintiffs’ Motion for
Reconsideration should be denied on procedural grounds alone.
B.

Plaintiffs’ Motion for Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint
All that has changed in Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint is that the Complaint has

been tweaked. No significant new facts are alleged. The only “new” facts alleged regarding The
King’s English and Sam Weller’s Bookstore are that The King’s English believes some of the
books they carry “could be deemed harmful to minors by some prosecutors in some Utah
counties,” ¶ 148, and Sam Weller’s regards the “marketing and the selling of books over the
Internet” to be an “important component to a viable book selling business today,” ¶ 150. That’s
it. No new facts are even offered as to the remaining previously dismissed Plaintiffs.
Since this Court has already ruled that six of the Plaintiffs do not have standing, and the
only thing the Second Amended Complaint does is to reinstate the previously dismissed
Plaintiffs, the Motion for Leave to Amend should also be denied.

II. SUBSTANTIVE BASIS FOR DENYING THE MOTIONS
A.

Standing
The issue here is standing. The previously dismissed Plaintiffs did not allege a credible

fear of being prosecuted in their first Amended Complaint and they do not overcome that defect
in their Motion for Reconsideration or Second Amended Complaint. They simply do not
demonstrate an injury-in-fact. “A federal court’s jurisdiction . . . can be invoked only when the
plaintiff himself has suffered ‘some threatened or actual injury resulting from the putatively
illegal action . . .’” Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975).
As the Tenth Circuit has noted, “[p]articularly important, for present purposes, is the
requirement of an ‘injury in fact,’ which the Supreme Court has defined as ‘an invasion of a
legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not
conjectural.’” Initiative and Referendum Inst. v. Walker, 450 F.3d 1082, 1087 (10th Cir. 2006),
citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). The Plaintiffs previously
dismissed simply do not meet that standard. Mere allegations of a subjective chill are “not an
adequate substitute for claim of specific present objective harm or a threat of specific future
harm.” Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 13-14 (1972). The chilling effect, to amount to an injury-infact, must arise from “an objectively justified fear of real consequences, which can be satisfied by
showing a credible threat of prosecution or other consequences flowing from the statute’s
enforcement.” D.L.S. v. Utah, 374 F.3d 971, 975 (10th Cir. 2004).
B.

Section 1231 – Filtering
In their Memorandum in Support of their motions Plaintiffs’ reference ACLU v. Johnson,

194 F.3d 1149 (1999) and American Libraries Ass’n v. Pataki, 969 F.Supp. 160 (S.D.N.Y. 1997)
4

for the proposition that “federal courts have regularly invalidated State regulations of, or burdens
on, the Internet.” They cite the Pataki case for the proposition that the Internet “requires a
cohesive national scheme of regulation.” Pataki, 969 F.Supp. at 182. Memorandum, p. 2.
At this point in time, those cases are of minimal value. As this Court noted last year, the
Pataki and Johnson cases “were decided before Congress enacted CAN-SPAM and are of limited
value in the discussion of whether Congress allowed for simultaneous State regulation.” Free
Speech Coalition v. Shurtleff, 2007 WL 922247, *11 (D. Utah Mar. 23, 2007) (slip op.). The
same can be said for subsequent filtering legislation passed by Congress a year after the Pataki
decision.
Public Law 105-277, which became effective October 21, 1998, included in the federal
Communications Act the “Internet Tax Freedom Act,” 47 U.S.C. § 151-1101 et seq., and an
Internet provision for the “Protection for private blocking and screening of offensive material.”
47 U.S.C. § 230. The Internet Tax Freedom Act, 47 U.S.C. § 151-1100 et seq., creates a
moratorium prohibiting States from imposing Internet access taxes on ISPs,2 – unless those ISPs
do not offer screening software3 to their customers. 47 U.S.C. § 151-1101(e)(1). In other words,
States are precluded from taxing ISPs like telephone companies; however, if an ISP does not
offer a filtering system to its customers they may be so taxed. A copy of the “Internet Tax
Freedom Act” is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

2

“No State or political subdivision thereof shall impose any of the following taxes during the period
beginning November 1, 2003, and ending November 1, 2014: (1) Taxes on Internet access.” 47 U.S.C. § 1511101(a)(1).
3

Screening software is defined as “software that is designed to permit a person to limit access to material on
the Internet that is harmful to minors.” 47 U.S.C. § 151-1101(e)(2)(C).

5

In the same legislation Congress makes “findings” and sets the “policy” of the United
States regarding the Internet. This is the “national scheme” called for in Pataki. Section 230 of
47 U.S.C. states “it is the policy of the United States . . . (4) to remove disincentives for the
development and utilization of blocking and filtering technologies that empower parents to
restrict their children’s access to objectionable or inappropriate online material; and (5) to insure
vigorous enforcement of Federal criminal laws to deter and punish trafficking in obscenity,
stalking or harassment by means of computer.” 47 U.S.C. § 230(a) & (b)(4) & (5). Specifically,
47 U.S.C. § 230 states in relevant part:
(d) Obligations of interactive computer service
A provider of interactive computer service shall, at the time of
entering an agreement with a customer for the provision of
interactive computer service and in a manner deemed appropriate
by the provider, notify such customer that parental control
protections (such as computer hardware, software, or filtering
services) are commercially available that may assist the customer
in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors. Such notice
shall identify, or provide the customer with access to information
identifying, current providers of such protections.
....
(e) Effect on other laws
....
(3) State law
Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent any State from
enforcing any State law that is consistent with this section. No
cause of action may be brought and no liability may be imposed
under any State or local law that is inconsistent with this section.
47 U.S.C. § 230(d) & (e)(3). (Emphasis added). A copy of 47 U.S.C. § 230 is attached hereto as
Exhibit B.
So a year after the Pataki decision calls for a “cohesive national scheme of regulation,”
which Plaintiffs want to say clearly deems the Utah statute unconstitutional, Congress passes
6

legislation stating that the policy of the United States regarding the Internet is to require ISPs to
notify customers of the availability of filtering software to allow State regulation of the Internet
consistent with federal law.
Section 1231 of the Utah law provides that “upon request by a consumer,” an ISP shall
filter content to prevent the transmission of material harmful to minors to the consumer. § 7610-1231(1)(a). The service provider complies with Subsection (1)(a) if it uses “a generally
accepted and commercially reasonable method of filtering.” § 76-10-1231(1)(b). An additional
amendment to the Act passed in the 2008 General Legislative Session made compliance with
Section 1231 even easier for ISPs. Now all an ISP has to do is provide the consumer with a
“clear and conspicuous hyperlink” or a written statement referring the user to a third-party for the
filtering software to comply with Section 1231. It is logical to conclude that the software would
be stocked and supported by the third-party, making any impact on the ISP de minimus.4
Citing ACLU v. Johnson, 194 F.2d 1149 (10th Cir. 1999), Plaintiffs assert this Court was
wrong when it concluded that they lacked standing to challenge Utah Code Ann. § 76-10-1231.

4

The 2008 Amendment states:
A service provider may comply with Subsection (1) by:
(i) providing in-network filtering to prevent receipt of material harmful to
minors, provided that the filtering does not affect or interfere with access to
Internet content for consumers who do not request filtering under Subsection (1);
or
(ii) providing software, [or] engaging a third party to provide software, or
referring users to a third party that provides filtering software, by providing a
clear and conspicuous hyperlink or written statement, for [contemporaneous]
installation on the consumer's computer that blocks, in an easy-to-enable and
commercially reasonable manner, receipt of material harmful to minors.

House Bill 18, Sub. 1 (2008 General Session of the Utah Legislature), signed by the
Governor on March 18, 2008.

7

Plaintiffs claim that Section 1231 attempts to “regulate the Internet” in violation of their rights
under Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. But filtering is different than the
circumstances in Johnson because Congress has expressly allowed simultaneous State regulation
with respect to Internet filters and filtering technology consistent with federal law.
“When Congress so chooses, State actions that it plainly authorizes are invulnerable to
constitutional attack under the commerce clause.” Northeast Bancorp, Inc. v. Board of
Governors, 472 U.S. 159, 174 (1985). The Supreme Court has also made it clear that “the States
retain authority under their general police powers to regulate matters of ‘legitimate local
concern,’ even though interstate commerce may be affected.” Lewis v. BT Investment
Managers, Inc., 447 U.S. 27, 36 (1980). In short, the dormant aspect of the Commerce Clause
was not intended “to cut the States off from legislating on all subjects relating to health, life, and
safety of their citizens, though the legislation might indirectly affect the commerce of the
country.” Huron Portland Cement Co. v. Detroit, 362 U.S. 440, 443-44 (1960). See Free Speech
Coalition, 2007 WL 922247, *11.
For the foregoing reasons, this Court was correct in concluding that the Internet service
provider Plaintiffs lack standing to assert the Act violates the Commerce Clause or any other
provision of the United States Constitution.
C.

Section 1205 – Inducing Acceptance of Pornographic Material
Utah Code Ann. § 76-10-1205 prohibits a person from “inducing” an end-user to receive

pornographic material as a condition of a sale for other items. None of the Plaintiffs assert, in
either the Motion for Reconsideration or the Motion for Leave, that they “induce” anyone into
accepting pornographic material by the purchase of other items. Therefore, all Plaintiffs lack
standing to assert a credible claim of prosecution against them under this section.
8

Next, the Plaintiffs reargue that this section is vague. Defendants strenuously disagree.
As this Court stated in its Opinion and Order: “the statute on its face is clear.” Opinion, p. 15.
Plaintiffs’ confusion comes from injecting the concept of “blocking” into the equation. Both of
the examples used by Plaintiffs in their Memorandum are dependent upon a consumer
demanding that an ISP or web hosting company “block” certain offensive material, and the ISP
or web hosting company refuses to do so. But the statute nowhere contains a blocking
provision.5 Thus, Plaintiffs have added an element which does not exist in the statute and then
claim that the statute is vague.
Because none of the Plaintiffs assert they are attempting to induce anyone into accepting
pornographic material by the purchase of other items. None of the Plaintiffs have standing to
challenge this section.
D.

Section 1206 – Dealing in Material Harmful to a Minor
In its Opinion and Order this Court dismissed The King’s English and Sam Weller’s Zion

Bookstore on the basis that their fear of prosecution was not credible. In the 30 years the harmful
to minors statute has been on the books in Utah, no case – or even threat of a case – has been
brought against these Plaintiffs. But in their attempt to have the Court reverse its decision, they
argue, again, that there are differences between brick-and-mortar stores and the Internet.
Differences there may be, but under § 1206 those differences inure more to the detriment
of the brick-and-mortar store than the Internet. For the sake of argument, let’s assume that at

5

The original Bill filed in 2005 (H.B. 260) did having a blocking component. Section 1232 of that Bill
gave customers the legal right to require ISPs to block certain websites, which the ISPs were required to do. That
section was completely deleted in H.B. 5 (2007).

9

least one of the books The King’s English or Sam Weller’s Bookstore carries may be found by a
court to be material harmful to minors.6
Now, what is the difference between a minor viewing the supposed offensive book in the
bookstore and viewing it on Plaintiffs’ website on the Internet? The difference is: in the brickand-mortar store the proprietor, or an employee of the proprietor, at least has an opportunity of
“knowing” whether the viewer is underage. On the Internet, no such opportunity exists.
Section § 1206 of Utah’s harmful to minors statute clearly states:
A person is guilty of dealing in material harmful to minors when, knowing that a
person is a minor, or having negligently failed to determine the proper age of a
minor. . .
Utah Code Ann. § 76-10-1206(1) (emphasis added). Given the present structure of the Internet,
Defendants are totally perplexed how The King’s English or Sam Weller’s Bookstore could be
charged under the statute with either “knowing that a person is a minor,” or “having negligently
failed to determine the age of a minor” when a minor views their website.
How a credible case could be brought against any of the Plaintiffs under this statute
because a minor viewed their website is a total mystery to these Defendants. It is not that the
chances are slim or even remote, but totally non-existent.
As the Court has previously found, these Plaintiffs simply do not allege a credible threat
of prosecution and therefore do not have standing to challenge the statute.

6

None of the books listed by Plaintiff The King’s English have ever been found by a court in the State of
Utah to be material harmful to minors. Thus, any categorization of such is an assumption at best. In Utah, magazine
and video shops that carry material harmful to minors cordon off sections of their store which contain the
objectionable material. Neither The King’s English nor Sam W eller’s has such a cordoned section, meaning they
obviously did not regard the books being cited in the Complaint as material harmful to a minor prior to the filing of
this case.

10

CONCLUSION
Plaintiffs’ Motion for Reconsideration and Motion for Leave to File a Second Amended
Complaint are duplicative. The issues presented in both Motions have been previously presented
to this Court and decided by this Court. Therefore, both Motions should be denied.
