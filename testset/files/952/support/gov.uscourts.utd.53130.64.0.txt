PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
FOR LEAVE TO FILE A SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT

Dockets.Justia.com
COMES NOW, Plaintiffs, by and through their undersigned counsel, and hereby files a
Motion for Reconsideration, or in the Alternative, Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint
pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a).

Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court reconsider the following three aspects of the
Court's November 29, 2007 Memorandum Opinion and Order (the "Opinion'"):

1) Holding that Plaintiffs IPNS of Utah, LLC and RigidTech.com, Inc. lack standing to
challenge 0x00A7 76-10-1231 under commerce clause;

2) Holding that Plaintiffs IPNS of Utah LLC and RigidTech.com, Inc., as well as all other
content-providing plaintiffs, lack standing to challenge 0x00A7 76-10-1205 under both the first
amendment and the commerce clause; and

3) Holding that Plaintiffs The King's English, Inc. and Sam Weller's Zion Bookstore lack
standing to challenge 0x00A7 76-10-1206.

In the alternative, Plaintiffs respectfully request leave to file a Second Amended
Complaint in order to more fully set forth the facts supporting Plaintiffs' standing to assert its
claims. A copy of the proposed Second Amended Complaint and a Proposed Order are attached
to the Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Reconsideration.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for an Order granting their Motion for Reconsideration on
the points stated above, or in alternative, leave to file a second amended complaint.

DATED this 19th day of February, 2008.
