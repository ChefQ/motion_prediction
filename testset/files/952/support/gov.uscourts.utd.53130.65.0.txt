MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR
RECONSIDERATION OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, FOR LEAVE TO FILE A
SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT

Dockets.Justia.com
Plaintiffs hereby submit this memorandum in support of their motion for reconsideration
of three aspects of the Court's November 29, 2007 Memorandum Opinion and Order (the
"Opinion") or, in the alternative, for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint (a copy of which
is attached hereto).

1. Plaintiffs IPNS of Utah, LLC and RigidTech.com, Inc. Have Standing to Challenge 0x00A7 76-
10-1231 Under the Commerce Clause.

The Court, in its Opinion, finds that IPNS of Utah, LLC and RigidTech.com, Inc. ("the
ISPs") lack standing to challenge 0x00A7 76-10-1231 under the Commerce Clause because the Court
rejected the ISPs' allegations that compliance with 0x00A7 76-10-1231 would be "burdensome and
costly." The Court also held that a challenge to 0x00A7 76-10-1231 based on the yet-to-be issued
regulations under that section is premature. See Opinion at p. 14. These conclusions both (a)
misapprehend the nature of the Commerce Clause challenge to any state regulation of the
Internet, and (b) fail to appropriately construe the ISPs' allegations of burden on a motion to
dismiss.

In the face of Commerce Clause challenges, federal courts have regularly invalidated
state regulations of, or burdens on, the Internet. Courts - with the Tenth Circuit taking a lead -
have determined that state Internet regulations are particularly suspect under the Commerce
Clause because of the Internet's uniquely non-geographic nature, which renders it vulnerable to

inconsistent state regulations.' As the Tenth Circuit noted in ACLU v. J ohnson, 194 F.3d 1149

 

! PSINet vy. Chapman, 362 F. 3d 227 (4th Cir. 2004) (Va. Statute); American Booksellers

Found. v. Dean, 342 F. 3d 96 (2d Cir. 2003) (Vt. Statute); ACLU v. Johnson, 194 F. 3d 1149
(10th Cir. 1999) (N.M. Statute); Southeast Booksellers Ass'n v. McMaster, 282 F.Supp. 2d 389
(D.S.C. 2003); 371 F.Supp. 2d 773 (D.S.C. 2005) (S.C. Statute); CDT v. Pappert, 337 F.Supp. 2d
606 (E.D. Penn. 2004),; ACLU v. Goddard, No. Civ. 00-0505 TUC-AM (D. Ariz. Aug. 11,
2004) (Ariz. Statute); Cyberspace Communications, Inc. v. Engler, 142 F Supp. 827 (E.D. Mich.
2001) (Mich. Statute); American Libraries Ass'n v. Pataki, 969 F.Supp. 160 (S.D. N.Y. 1997)
(1999), "the Supreme Court has long recognized that certain types of commerce are uniquely
suited to national, as opposed to state, regulation." Jd. at 1160. The Tenth Circuit continued:
"[C]ertain types of commerce have been recognized as requiring national regulation. The
Internet is surely such a medium." Id. 1162 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). The Tenth
Circuit specifically agreed with the conclusion in the leading Internet Commerce Clause case,
American Libraries Ass'n v. Pataki, 969 F. Supp. 160 (S.D.N.Y. 1997), which held that like the
national railroad system, the Internet " `requires a cohesive national scheme of regulation.' "
ACLU v. Johnson, 194 F.3d at 1162 (emphasis added) (quoting Pataki, 969 F. Supp. at 182).*
In this case, the fact that the Utah Division of Consumer Protection has not issued
regulations or testing procedures that would apply to the plaintiff ISPs under 0x00A7 76-10-1231 is
irrelevant to the resolution of the Commerce Clause challenge. Any state tests or regulations -
no matter what they say -- would subject the ISPs (both of which have customers both in and
outside of Utah, see Amended Complaint {{ 28, 29) to the risk of inconsistent state-by-state
regulation, in violation of the Commerce Clause. If 0x00A7 76-10-1231 were to be upheld, Utah would
be the first state in the nation to be able to regulate the Internet (and thus there would not in the
first instance be any actual "inconsistency"). But the Commerce Clause does not require that a
plaintiff wait until two states have in fact created inconsistent regulations - indeed, under the
Commerce Clause, the harm is done whenever an interstate business must design its operations

or modify its product offerings to comply with the first state's regulations. If a particular type of

 

(N.Y. Statute). But see American Booksellers for Free Expression v. Strickland, 512 F.Supp. 2d
1082 (S.D. Ohio 2007) (Ohio Statute) (dicta to the contrary).

0x00B0 See also, e.g., American Booksellers Found. v. Dean, 342 F.3d 96, 104 (2d Cir. 2003)
("We think it likely that the Internet will soon be seen as falling within the class of subjects that
are protected from State regulation because they `imperatively demand a single uniform rule."")
(quoting Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 53 U.S. 299, 319 (1852)).

3
business (such as the Internet, see ACLU v. Johnson) is not susceptible to state-by-state
regulation, then regulation even by a single state violates the Commerce Clause.

Moreover, the risk of inconsistent regulation becomes almost an absolute certainty when
the subject of regulation is by definition inherently dependent on /ocal community standards, as
compliance with 0x00A7 76-10-1231 would be. Thus, even if the states of Utah and Oregon (where in
this case one of the ISPs also has customers) were to enact statutes and regulations based on 0x00A7
76-10-1231 using similar or the same words (requiring service providers to filter out "harmful to
minors" material), what is deemed to be "harmful to minors" under community standards in Utah
is almost certain to be quite different than what is "harmful to minors" under Oregon community
standards. Given inherent dependence on local community standards under 0x00A7 76-10-1231, the
risk of inconsistent state regulation is extremely high. That statutory section violates the
Commerce Clause regardless of what tests and regulations the Utah Division of Consumer
Protection ultimately might promulgate.

The Court also denied standing to the ISPs to challenge 0x00A7 76-10-1231 because it did not
credit the ISP plaintiffs' allegations that compliance with 0x00A7 76-10-1231 would be "burdensome
and costly." As an initial matter, even if compliance with a Utah regulation of the Internet were
not very burdensome or costly, such regulation would still violate the Commerce Clause because

inherently interstate businesses should be protected from inconsistent state-by-state regulations,

even if the regulations are not very burdensome or costly.

 

3 Surely if the Utah Legislature enacted a statute that required all railroads that operate in

or pass through Utah to utilize a gauge of track to be determined by regulations to be issued by
the Utah Division of Consumer Protection, the railroad would not be required to wait for the
issuance of the regulations before it could bring a Commerce Clause challenge against the statute
itself.
But in this case, compliance with 0x00A7 76-10-1231 would be "burdensome and costly" as a

matter of fact, as the ISP plaintiffs' alleged. Plaintiffs also alleged that they have customers both

in and outside of Utah (and thus would be subject to two or more states' regulation, if courts

permit states to impose statutes such as 0x00A7 76-10-1231). In light of the inherently local nature of 0x00A7

76-10-1231, and the Court's obligations to accept the ISPs' allegations as true and construe them

in favor of the complaining party, plaintiffs believe that the Amended Complaint is adequate to

establish standing. Ifthe Court prefers to grant leave, plaintiffs would be willing, however, to

again amend their complaint to make the burdens and costs more clear. Among the additional

facts that plaintiffs allege in the proposed Second Amended Complaint are:

both ISPs are small companies - with very lean staffs - that are attempting to
compete in markets with extremely small profit margins, such that adding staffing
and support obligations (to provide state-mandated filtering services or software,
support their customers' use of such services or software, and submit their
services and software to tests and regulations imposed by the Utah Division of
Consumer Protection) can have a serious, concrete and negative impact on the
viability of the ISPs' businesses;

although one ISP does already offer a filtering capability to its customers, that
capability is uniform across a multi-state customer base in which Utah customers
are a fairly small minority, and having to offer three or more different filtering
services to comply with differing regulations in, for example, Utah, Oregon, &
Washington states (assuming that Utah and other states were all permitted to
impose regulations as required under 0x00A7 76-10-1231) would in fact be disruptive
and costly to the ISP;

for the other ISP plaintiff that does not offer any type of filtering product, 0x00A7 76-
10-1231 would be burdensome on the ISP by requiring it to divert already limited
staff resources to acquiring, stocking, and supporting a filtering product, and
submitting such product to the regulations and tests to by Utah (as well as those

set by other states, if Utah is permitted to impose regulations and tests on the
ISP); and

recent surveys and court decisions have concluded that the majority of parents in
the US. already use filtering products, which are readily available in the
marketplace (without any state-by-state regulations whatsoever), and thus the
truly minimal arguable local benefit of 0x00A7 76-10-1231 is outweighed by the
interstate burden imposed by the statute.

5
Plaintiffs respectfully urge this Court to find that the ISPs have standing to challenge 0x00A7
76-10-1231 under the Commerce Clause. If an amendment to the complaint would facilitate
such a finding, plaintiffs stand ready to do so.

II. Plaintiffs ISPs Have Standing to Challenge 0x00A7 76-10-1205 Under Both the First
Amendment and the Commerce Clause.

Plaintiffs maintain that they have standing to assert three independent claims against 0x00A7
76-10-1205: based on the First Amendment, the Commerce Clause, and 47 U.S.C. 0x00A7 230 (as
referenced in Count VIII of the Amended Complaint):

First Amendment: Although the Court states in its Opinion, at 15, that 0x00A7 76-10-1205
"on its face is clear," plaintiffs, with respect, still do not know what 0x00A7 76-10-1205 means (a) in
the context of an ISP offering Internet access service to customers, and (b) in the context of a
web host company (including, under the terms of the statute, non-Utah-based companies)
offering hosting services. This vagueness - in a criminal statute that is being applied to speech
on the Internet - will have exactly the type of chilling impact that the First Amendment
prohibits. The Supreme Court addressed these precise factors in Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844
(1997), involving the Communications Decency Act ("CDA"):

The vagueness of the CDA is a matter of special concern for two
reasons. First, the CDA is a content based regulation of speech.
The vagueness of such a regulation raises special First Amendment
concerns because of its obvious chilling effect on free speech.
Second, the CDA is a criminal statute. In addition to the
opprobrium and stigma of a criminal conviction, the CDA
threatens violators with penalties including up to two years in
prison for each act of violation. The severity of criminal sanctions

may well cause speakers to remain silent rather than communicate
even arguably unlawful words, ideas, and images.

Id. at 871.
Although the Court identified one hypothetical in which 0x00A7 76-10-1205 might apply - a scenario

in which a contract for service would "have an express requirement that the end-user receive
6
pornography material" - nothing in the statutory language limits it to an "express" contractual

requirement (and indeed, in the off-line context of magazine distributors, 0x00A7 76-10-1205 would

certainly apply to "inducement" even in the absence of an express contractual requirement). If

the Court (or the Utah Supreme Court) were able to provide a definitive interpretation of 0x00A7 76-

10-1205, binding on Defendants and stating that in the Internet context an express contractual

requirement is an essential element of the crime specified in 0x00A7 76-10-1205, then plaintiffs would

agree that the ISP plaintiffs do not have standing because they would not meet the elements of

the crime.

But in the absence of such a binding holding, 0x00A7 76-10-1205 certainly could reach the

following scenario involving an ISP:

e

a Utah customer of a plaintiff ISP receives an unsolicited e-mail ("spam")
containing pornographic material, through an e-mail service provided by the ISP;

the customer demands that the ISP block all such pornographic material; and

after the customer (through no fault or involvement of the ISP) receives another
piece of spam with pornography, the customer files a complaint with one of the
Defendants claiming that the ISP is guilty of the felony identified in 0x00A7 76-10-
1205.

Along the same lines, 0x00A7 76-10-1205 could also reach the following scenario involving a non-

Utah web hosting company:

as the Court notes, many of the in-state and out-of-state plaintiffs (or their
members) provide "harmful-to-minors" content on their websites;

those plaintiffs (or their members) usually must use the services of a web hosting
company, which often hosts both sexual and non-sexual content on the same web
servers;

a Utah citizen accesses the "harmful to minors" content on the web host's server,
"reasonably" concludes that the content is pornographic, and demands that the
web hosting company remove the content from their web server, arguing that 0x00A7
76-10-1205 prohibits the web host from mixing both "pornographic" and non-
pornographic material on the same web server.

7
In both of these scenarios, the service provider would be facing felony charges, and would either
be technically unable to comply (in the ISP scenario) or would comply by removing (and
therefore chilling) speech that is lawful for the original poster to make available over the
Internet. In both situations, the First Amendment prohibits Utah's chilling of free speech caused
by the threat of criminal sanctions under 0x00A7 76-10-1205. The vagueness of the Utah statute raises
the exact same vagueness concerns identified by the Supreme Court in Reno v. ACLU.

As both ISPs and web hosts, the ISP plaintiffs have standing to object to this vague
criminal threat, and the in-state and out-of-state content providers have standing to object to the
chill on free speech that will be caused by hosting companies around the country acting
cautiously in response to this Utah criminal statute.

Commerce Clause: For many of the same reasons discussed immediately above with
regard to 0x00A7 76-10-1231, the chilling effect of 0x00A7 76-10-1205 on the actions of the plaintiff ISPs
(both as access providers and as web hosts) is an unconstitutional burden on interstate
communications, in violation of the Commerce Clause. Similarly, both in-state and out-of-state
content providers have standing under the Commerce Clause to challenge the harmful chilling
effect of 0x00A7 76-10-1205 on the willingness of web hosting companies around the country from
hosting lawful content that might make them subject to Utah's 0x00A7 76-10-1205 criminal statute.

47 U.S.C. 230: By attempting to impose responsibility on both ISPs and web hosting
companies for Internet content posted by other entities, 0x00A7 76-10-1205 violates the terms of 47
US.C. 0x00A7 230(c)(1), and as such is preempted pursuant to 0x00A7 230(e)(3) of that statute (as
challenged in Count VIII of the Amended Complaint). Section 230 insulates ISPs and web
hosting companies from being held in any way responsible for or penalized because of online

content posted by others.
As Section 230 explains:
It is the policy of the United States . . . to preserve the vibrant and
competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet and

other interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or State
regulation....

47 U.S.C. 0x00A7 230(b)(2) (emphasis added). By imposing criminal liability on ISPs and web hosts
for content posted on the Internet by third parties (including, in the web hosting example,
customers of the web hosting company), 0x00A7 76-10-1205 violates the terms of Section 230(c)(1)
and is thus expressly preempted by 0x00A7 230(e)(3). Both ISPs who are directly affected by 0x00A7 76-10-
1205, and content providers who benefit from the protections of Section 230 and would suffer
from the chilling effect of 0x00A7 76-10-1205, have standing to assert the preemption of 0x00A7 76-10-1205.

Il. Plaintiffs The King's English, Inc. and Sam Weller's Zion Bookstore Have Standing to
Challenge 0x00A776-10-1206.

The Court in its November 29, 2007 Memorandum Opinion and Order (the "Opinion'')

 

finds that the fear of prosecution pled by The King's English, Inc. ("King's English") and Sam
Weller's Zion Bookstore ("Sam Weller") was not credible and "mere speculation" because:
The Court cannot accept Plaintiff's argument that the same books
advertised and sold in the store - which have never been held to

violate the Act - will now somehow be deemed by the State of
Utah to violate the Act by being advertised and sold on-line.

(Opinion at p. 9.) On this basis (as well as others discussed below), standing was denied to these
plaintiffs.

This is not an appropriate test. There are well-recognized differences between having a
book for sale in a bricks and mortar store and posting a portion of it - such as the cover - ona
website. The First Amendment analysis dealing "`with traditional bookstores at physical
locations ... does not apply to the `unique and wholly new medium of world-wide

communication' that is the Internet." PSINet v. Chapman, 362 F. 3d 227, 233 (4th Cir. 2004)

9
(citing Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 850 (1997). The key differences relevant to these parties
and the statute at issue are as follows:

1. 0x00A7 76-10-1206 deals with the offer or distribution to a minor of material that is
harmful to minors. In the context of a retail establishment, the retailer deals face-to-face with the
prospective customer. If the prospective customer is a minor and the work sought to be
purchased is inappropriate for the age or maturity of the minor, the retailer can dissuade the
minor from purchasing the work or refuse to sell it to him or her, and thus avoid legal
complications. If one posts a cover or an excerpt on the Internet, as plaintiffs pled and will
prove, there is no practical way to determine whether the material is viewed by a minor -- except
possibly by mandatory filtering which unduly and unconstitutionally restricts adult access to
constitutionally protected material. This inability to screen out minors - inherent in how the
Internet operates - is precisely one of the critical factors that led the Supreme Court to strike
down the Communications Decency Act in Reno v. ACLU, and led the district court to strike

down the follow-on "Child Online Protection Act" in ACLU v. Gonzales, 478 F.Supp. 2d. 775

 

(E.D. PA. 2007).

2. Under 0x00A7 76-10-1206, material is harmful to minors if, among other things, it "is
patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what
is suitable material for minors." 0x00A7 76-10-1206(4)(b). Although it is not entirely clear, it appears
from 0x00A7 76-10-1201(1) that the community under Utah law is local, "the vicinage where an
offense ... occurred." Thus King's English and Sam Weller's have a legitimate concern that
what may be appropriate for a minor in Salt Lake City, may not be so in a more conservative

county elsewhere in Utah in which their web sites are viewed.
