MDL 2592
SECTION L

MAGISTRATE JUDGE NORTH

************************
PLAINTIFFS’ RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO
DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO QUASH SUBPOENA FOR SANJAY JALOTA
TO APPEAR AND TESTIFY AT A HEARING OR TRIAL IN A CIVIL ACTION
I.

INTRODUCTION
Plaintiffs oppose Defendants’ Motion to Quash Subpoena related to Sanjay Jalota (Rec.

Doc. 6556), for the same reasons they opposed Defendants’ Motion to Quash Subpoena related to
Dr. Gary Peters (Rec. Doc. 6277), which motion was denied by court order (Rec. Doc. 6295). Mr.
Jalota has been employed by Johnson & Johnson (J&J”)/Janssen since April 2003, and was directly
involved with due diligence activities for the development and regulatory approval of Xarelto, as
discussed more fully below. Given the importance of the MDL’s second bellwether trial,
Defendants’ efforts to obstruct the proceedings should be rejected. For the reasons set forth below,
the motion should be denied.
II.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Mr. Jalota was the Director of Global Regulatory Affairs from May 2006 through

October 2007. From there, he became the Senior Director of Cardiovascular and Metabolism
TA Regulatory Affairs, and he is presently the Senior Director of Global Regulatory Affairs.
According to Mr. Jalota’s Curriculum Vitae (attached as Exhibit 1), he was responsible for

1

Case 2:14-md-02592-EEF-MBN Document 6571 Filed 05/23/17 Page 2 of 13

J&J’s collaboration with Bayer HealthCare on rivaroxaban and due diligence activities for
Cardiovascular compounds, and in that role, he:


Achieved two of the top ten J&J company goals of successful FPI in
ATLAS TIMI 46 ACS and ROCKET AF studies in the fourth quarter
of 2006;



Provided regulatory guidance to the internal J&J compound
development team and the cross-company Global Development
Committee;



Prepared briefing packages and led project team leaders at regulatory
authority meetings, including meetings with the FDA, Health Canada,
the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medical Products for
Human Use Scientific Advice Working Party, and Japan’s
Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency;



Developed regulatory strategic plans for the initial and life cycle
management indications in conjunction with Bayer HealthCare; and



Had proactive involvement in the development of the contract and
cross-company processes, including pharmacovigilance and safety
oversight, delegation of responsibilities, publication review,
investigator initiated studies, clinical supply agreements, informed
consent, and contract templates.

As such, Mr. Jalota is a witness with high levels of responsibility, influence, and
decision-making authority in areas particularly relevant to the issues in this case.
III.

ARGUMENT
A.

Mr. Jalota will not be required to travel out-of-state and more than 100 miles
to testify at trial.

Plaintiffs’ subpoena provides for Mr. Jalota’s appearance at “a mutually agreed upon
location,” and per agreement with defense counsel, if the subpoena is not quashed, that location
will be at the federal courthouse for the District of New Jersey, in Newark, New Jersey. This is
within the state in which Mr. Jalota works and resides (New Jersey), within 22 miles from the city
in which he resides (Warren), and within 37 miles from the city in which he works (Raritan). His

2

Case 2:14-md-02592-EEF-MBN Document 6571 Filed 05/23/17 Page 3 of 13

testimony can then be broadcast live from that federal courthouse to the courtroom in the Eastern
District of Louisiana. Thus, there will be complete compliance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(c)(1), and
the entire first section of Defendants’ brief is moot.
B.

Rules 43(a) and 45(c)(1) empower this Court to compel Mr. Jalota to testify
via live testimony broadcasted from New Jersey.

Under Rule 45 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, this Court may issue a subpoena for
a witness to appear at trial either: (a) within 100 miles of where the person resides, is employed, or
regularly transacts business in person; or (b) within the state where the person resides, is employed,
or regularly transacts business in person if he or she is a party or a party’s officer, or if he or she is
commanded to attend the trial and would not incur substantial expense in doing so. Fed. R. Civ. P.
45(c)(1). Further, Rule 43 provides:
At trial, the witnesses’ testimony must be taken in open court unless
a federal statute, the Federal Rules of Evidence, these rules, or
other rules adopted by the Supreme Court provide otherwise. For
good cause in compelling circumstances and with appropriate
safeguards, the court may permit testimony in open court by
contemporaneous transmission from a different location.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 43(a) (emphasis added).
Similar to Defendants here, the defendants in In re Actos (Pioglitazone) Prods. Liab. Litig.,
No. 12-cv-00064, 2014 WL 107153 (W.D. La. Jan. 8, 2014), argued that Rules 43 and 45 could
not be read together to allow the court to order video testimony that would take place outside
of the court’s subpoena power, even for a party’s employee. But the Actos court rejected this
argument: “Nothing in Rule 45, itself, indicates the Rule must be read in the vacuum Defendants
argue; to the contrary, Rule 45 must be read in tandem with Rule 43 and as a part of a harmonious
whole that is the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.” Id. at *9. I n d o i n g s o , the court explained

3

Case 2:14-md-02592-EEF-MBN Document 6571 Filed 05/23/17 Page 4 of 13

that Rule 43 allows for an appearance in open court by live video feed under certain circumstances,
and Rule 45 “provides the mechanism to secure such appearance.” Id. at *9.
Reading these rules in pari materia, as a whole, it is clear that this Court can subpoena
witnesses under Rule 45 to testify at trial by video transmission, regardless of the point of origin
for that video transmission:
A fair reading of the definition in Rule 43 of an appearance ‘IN
OPEN COURT’ ‘at trial,’ specifically includes an appearance via
live transmission, together with a fair reading of the scope of
activities permitted to be ordered by subpoena under Rule 45
(specifically, a person may be ordered to ‘attend a trial’), establishes
that the two Rules embrace and address the concept of appearance
at ‘trial’ to include contemporaneous live transmission from
another location at the location of the Court. One would not argue
that when using a written deposition or video deposition the witness
is not appearing at trial ‘by way of deposition,’ at the location of the
trial, notwithstanding the fact that the deposition was taken at
another location. Nor would one argue Rule 45 would not allow the
use of a subpoena to assure that ‘appearance by deposition.’ Here,
contemporaneous transmission is now equally incorporated as
proper trial procedure and an acceptable means of appearing at court
and trial, as were written and video depositions, respectively, in the
past. The subpoena power of Rule 45 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure is merely employed to facilitate yet another, now
permitted, trial procedure and method of appearance. …
The Defendants’ argued interpretation of the safeguards required for
use of Rule 43 would narrow the scope of the authority granted to
federal courts by allowing contemporaneous transmission only
when the absent witness agrees to appear voluntarily; that is not
the limitation(s) included within Rule 43 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure. No such limitation appears on the face of Rule 43, nor is
found within the comments addressing the Rule, and this Court will
not impose such an unjustified gloss on the rule by jurisprudential
fiat.
Id. (emphasis in original).
The purpose behind Rule 45 is to avoid an undue expense and inconvenience on a witness
by requiring the witness to travel unreasonably far for a deposition, hearing, or trial. In the situation

4

Case 2:14-md-02592-EEF-MBN Document 6571 Filed 05/23/17 Page 5 of 13

where testimony by live video feed is warranted, however, this concern is moot, since the witness
is able to testify from a location at or near the witness’s home or office. Accordingly, ordering live
video testimony “would benefit and not undermine the inherent goal of our system of
justice.” Id. at *6 (emphasis in original).
Similar reasoning was used by the court in the DePuy litigation, when ordering testimony
via contemporaneous transmission:
Plaintiffs do not seek to employ Rules 43 and 45 to obtain
contemporaneous transmission of live testimony in lieu of in-court
testimony. Rather, Plaintiffs seek to compel contemporaneous
transmission of live testimony where a witness under Defendants’
control is unable to appear live in court. Without this
contemporaneous transmission to provide live testimony, the jury
would be left with less reliable deposition transcripts and video.
Plaintiffs’ motion serves the inherent goal of Rule 43, which is to
provide the jury with a more truthful witness. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 43
advisory committee’s note (1996 amendment) (“The very ceremony
of trial and the presence of the factfinder may exert a powerful force
for truthtelling.”).
In re: DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., No. 3:11-md-2244, slip op. at 5 (N.D. Tex. Sept. 20, 2016)
(attached as Exhibit 2).
The Roundtree case, on which Defendants rely, erroneously considered video transmission
as moving the trial to the physical location of the person testifying. See Roundtree v. Chase Bank
USA, N.A., No. 13-cv-239, 2014 WL 2480259, *1-2 (W.D. Wash. June 3, 2014). Indeed, the plain
language of Rule 43 treats videoconferencing as equivalent to testimony in open court at the place
of trial. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 43(a) (permitting “testimony in open court by contemporaneous
transmission from a different location”).
Courts have likewise considered a live video feed to be testimony at trial. See, e.g., Lopez
v. NTI, LLC, 748 F. Supp. 2d 471, 480 (D. Md. 2010) (finding no prejudice to defendants in using
videoconferencing, because “[e]ach of the witnesses will testify in open court, under oath, and will
5

Case 2:14-md-02592-EEF-MBN Document 6571 Filed 05/23/17 Page 6 of 13

face cross-examination”); FTC v. Swedish Match North Am., Inc., 197 F.R.D. 1, 2 (D.C. 2000)
(finding same and noting “no practical difference between live testimony and contemporaneous
video transmission based upon [his] experience.”). Thus, the use of videoconferencing allows the
witness to testify at trial without running afoul of the geographical limitations for subpoenas
specified in Rule 45. See also Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(c)(1), Advisory Committee Note to the 2013
Amendments (“When an order under Rule 43(a) authorizes testimony from a remote location, the witness
can be commanded to testify from any place described in Rule 45(c)(1).”); Fed. R. Civ. P. 1 (directing that
rules “be construed and administered to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action
and proceeding”).
Because a plain reading of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure enables this Court to
subpoena Mr. Jalota to testify via videoconference from a location within 100 miles of his home
and office, this Court has the power to compel him to testify at trial, as was done with Dr. Peters in
the Boudreaux trial
C.

Good cause and compelling circumstances, and no associated unfair burden or
prejudice, are associated with compelling Mr. Jalota to testify via live
testimony broadcasted from New Jersey.

Live testimony is preferable to deposition testimony for a variety of reasons. For instance,
it allows juries to engage in more robust credibility assessments. See, e.g., Ramada Worldwide,
Inc. v. Bellmark Sarasota Airport, No. 05-cv-2309, 2006 WL 1675067, at *4 (D.N.J. June
15, 2006) (explaining “live testimony is recognized as especially preferable over depositions
where the factfinder will be making credibility determinations”); Iorio v. Allianz Life Ins. Co., No.
05-cv-633, 2009 WL 3415703, at *5 (S.D. Cal. Oct. 21, 2009) (acknowledging “inherent disparity
between depositions and live testimony, especially when credibility is at issue”); Fed. R. Civ.

6

Case 2:14-md-02592-EEF-MBN Document 6571 Filed 05/23/17 Page 7 of 13

P. 43, Advisory Committee Note to the 1996 Amendments (“The very ceremony of trial and the
presence of the factfinder may exert a powerful force for truthtelling.”).
Thus, “deposition testimony is only a substitute, not to be resorted to if the witness can
appear in person.” Banks v. Yokemick, 144 F. Supp. 2d 272, 288 (S.D.N.Y. 2001); see also
Estate of Spear v. Comm’r, 41 F.3d 103, 116 (3d Cir. 1994) (“[L]ive testimony is generally
preferable to videotaped testimony”); COA Network, Inc. v. J2 Global Commc’ns, Inc., No. 09cv-6505, 2010 WL 2539692, at *4 (D.N.J. Jun. 17, 2010) (“Live testimony is generally
preferred and parties should not unnecessarily be forced to rely on trial by deposition.”); Flores
v. NJ Transit Rail Operations, Inc., No. 96-cv-3237, 1998 WL 1107871, at *2 (D.N.J. Nov. 2,
1998) (“Although the increasing availability and fidelity of videotaped depositions has provided
a better alternative than reading a written transcription, the preference for live testimony is still
endorsed by federal courts.”); Sherwood Grp., Inc. v. Rittereiser, No. 90-cv-2414, 1990 WL
159925, at *6 (D.N.J. Oct. 17, 1990) (“[L]ive testimony is preferable to deposition testimony”);
accord Buchwald v. Renco Grp., Inc., No. 13-cv-7948, 2014 WL 4207113, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug.
25, 2014) (“[T]he preference for live testimony” is “dictated by . . . common sense”).
This alone, especially considering the importance of Mr. Jalota as a witness in this
litigation, sufficiently shows “good cause and compelling circumstances.” Additionally, when
determining whether there is good cause and compelling circumstances, other courts have
considered the following factors:
(1) the control exerted over the witness by the defendant; (2) the
complex, multi-party, multi-state nature of the litigation; (3) the
apparent tactical advantage, as opposed to any real inconvenience to
the witness, that the defendant is seeking by not producing the
witness voluntarily; (4) the lack of any true prejudice to the
defendant; and (5) the flexibility needed to manage a complex multidistrict litigation.

7

Case 2:14-md-02592-EEF-MBN Document 6571 Filed 05/23/17 Page 8 of 13

In re Vioxx Prods. Liab. Litig., 439 F. Supp. 2d 640, 643 (E.D. La. 2006). Here, all of these factors
weigh in favor of allowing live testimony by video of Mr. Jalota, as they did with Dr. Peters in
Boudreaux.
In regards to the first factor, as with Dr. Peters, Mr. Jalota continues to be employed by the
Janssen Defendants, and thus Janssen may exert significant control over him.
As to the second factor, the Xarelto MDL continues to be a complex litigation involving
thousands of plaintiffs from across the country. In particular, the Orr bellwether case will influence
the claims of plaintiffs in future bellwether cases, and inform thousands of other Xarelto cases.
Further, the corporate deposition at issue was comprised of massive amounts of testimony. While
designations from the transcript have been made, any videotaped deposition testimony would require
splicing together testimony from different examiners, creating more work for the lawyers and the
Court on the eve of trial, and disserving the jury in its presentation.
As for Defendants’ argument that permitting live video testimony could provide
technological disruptions, that argument is unavailing. Certainly, the editing and playing of
spliced deposition testimony would also introduce potential technological disruptions, as well as
require this Court to spend time ruling on more deposition designations and objections. Since live
testimony is always better than taped testimony, the fact that the outcome of this trial will bear on
many more cases beyond the bounds of this consolidated trial continues to weigh in favor of
allowing Mr. Jalota to testify live via video.
Defendants have exaggerated the impact and significance of a handful of small “technical
issues” from Dr. Peters’s trial testimony in Boudreaux to argue that the transmission of testimony
from Mr. Jalota would be challenging. Each “issue” was minimal – an attorney not facing the
witness (with which Dr. Peters did not indicate he had a problem), a need to look at hard copies

8

Case 2:14-md-02592-EEF-MBN Document 6571 Filed 05/23/17 Page 9 of 13

of documents rather than documents on the screen (which the witness did many times on his own),
and a need to repeat a few questions (which is not unusual during any examination). These are
certainly not sufficient to justify resort to spliced deposition testimony instead of live testimony.
Indeed, many would be replicated even with live testimony. Witnesses often prefer to look at a
document in their hands rather than a document on a screen, as Dr. Peters did repeatedly during
his testimony, even when the documents on the screen were unquestionably clear, and questions
or testimony sometimes need to be repeated for a myriad of reasons, such as soft voices, an
attorney and witness talking over each other, or background noises. Dr. Peters’s testimony was
efficient, and its transmission resulted in no real issues that were not quickly resolved.
For the third and fourth factors, Defendants’ opposition is a purely tactical decision, as there
can be no real claim of undue prejudice. Courts have been allowing live testimony via video for
decades, and this technology is easier to use now, more than ever. While the parties may choose
to send counsel to the witnesses, while also having counsel in the courtroom, any related expenses
should be considered a normal trial expense, and will be minimal compared to the overall cost of
this litigation. This is especially true considering that the proffered location is within 37 miles
of a principal place of business for Janssen, in Raritan, New Jersey.
Finally, with respect to the fifth factor, live video transmission will promote
comprehensiveness and coherency, especially when the alternative is spliced, edited, and recompiled
clips of depositions. This is particularly important here, where the deposition was taken over
one year ago, in March 2016. This was long before discovery was completed, and long
before any experts submitted reports or sat for depositions, so Mr. Jalota was not, and could
not have been, deposed on all material matters.

9

Case 2:14-md-02592-EEF-MBN Document 6571 Filed 05/23/17 Page 10 of 13

In Actos, the court noted that assumptions about the witnesses’ unavailability were not even
necessary, because there were “ample other reasons” to justify granting the plaintiffs’ request.
Actos, 2014 WL 107153, at *7 n.18. The court noted that the plaintiffs could not command the
witnesses’ appearance in open court in any way other than by video transmission. Id. at *7. Further,
the fact that the case was a complex, multi-party, multi-state litigation that required flexible
management weighed heavily in favor of granting the plaintiffs’ motion, as they did in Vioxx and
Washington Public. Id. at *8. “Even more persuasive” was the fact that live video would allow the
jury to “see” the witness, while avoiding the shortcomings of deposition video recorded prior to
developments leading up to and during the trial. Id. Similarly, all of these factors are present here.
D.

Defendants’ cases are not compelling.

Many of the cases cited by Defendants (in its current memorandum and in its past
memorandum that was incorporated by reference) are inapposite. For example, in some of the
cited cases, remote testimony via contemporaneous transmission was never offered as an option.
See, e.g., Twyman v. S&M Auto Brokers, No. 16-cv-4182, 2016 WL 6082357, at *5 (N.D. Ill.
Oct. 18, 2016); E.E.O.C. v. JetStream Ground Servs., Inc., No. 13-cv-02340, 2016 WL 1178668,
at *3 n.5 (D. Colo. Mar. 28, 2016); Ishee v. Fed. Nat’l Mortg. Assoc., No. 13-cv-234, 2014 WL
12638499, at *2 (S.D. Miss. Nov. 13, 2014). See also Prideaux v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 387 Fed.
App’x 474, 479 (5th Cir. 2010) (offered contemporaneous option was telephone) Matovski v.
Matovski, No. 06-cv-4259, 2007 WL 1575253, at *2-3 (S.D.N.Y. May 31, 2007) (same).
In many other cases cited by Defendants, testimony via contemporaneous transmission
was criticized or deemed unacceptable due to its inferiority to live testimony. The rulings did not
address whether a witness who had been previously deposed could be compelled to testify a
second time via contemporaneous transmission. In fact, the opposite situation existed in some of

10

Case 2:14-md-02592-EEF-MBN Document 6571 Filed 05/23/17 Page 11 of 13

those cases, in that the moving party was criticized for not previously obtaining deposition
testimony from a witness who was allegedly unavailable to testify live. See, e.g., Eller v. Trans
Union, LLC, 739 F.3d 467, 477-79 (10th Cir. 2013); United States v. Thompson, 599 F.3d 595,
600 n.4 (7th Cir. 2010); Humbert v. O’Malley, 303 F.R.D. 461, 466 n.24 (D. Md. 2014); Niemeyer
v. Ford Motor Co., No. 09-cv-2091, 2012 WL 5199145, at *3 (D. Nev. Oct. 18, 2012); Rodriguez
v. SGLC, Inc., No. 08-cv-01971, 2012 WL 3704922, at *2-3 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 24, 2012); Thomas
v. O’Brien, No. 08-cv-0318, 2011 WL 5452012, at *4 n.8 (N.D.N.Y. Nov. 8, 2011); Sille v.
Parball Corp., No. 07-cv-00901, 2011 WL 2680560, at *1-2 (D. Nev. July 8, 2011); Gulino v.
Bd. of Educ., No. 96-cv-8414, 2003 WL 1191349, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 13, 2003).
Other cited cases suggested that the rulings might have been different if MDL cases had
been involved. See, e.g., Aranda v. Caribbean Cruise Line, Inc., No. 12-cv-4069, slip op. at 2
(N.D. Ill. Aug. 30, 2016) (attached as Exhibit E to Defendants’ Brief); Williams v. Arctic Cat,
Inc., No. 11-cv-445, 2014 WL 1028476, at *5 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 13, 2014). While Defendants claim
that such a result violates the Rules Enabling Clause, that is inaccurate. No one is arguing for
different rules in different cases. Rather, the application of the law to the facts results in a different
outcome, depending in part on whether MDL cases are involved, which by no means violates the
Rules Enabling Clause.
Finally,

reasonable

case-specific

explanations

for

rejecting

testimony

via

contemporaneous transmission was given in other cited cases. For example, in Passmore v.
Barrett, No. 13-cv-290, 2016 WL 1253541 (N.D. Ind. Mar. 31, 2016), the court relied in part on
the fact that to allow such testimony would require the witness to sit for an extended period, which
contra-indicated the recommendation of his doctor, and was unnecessary given his past deposition
testimony. See id. at *3. Another cited case, Ping-Kuo Lin v. Horan Capital Mgmt., LLC, No.

11

Case 2:14-md-02592-EEF-MBN Document 6571 Filed 05/23/17 Page 12 of 13

14-cv-5202, 2014 WL 3974585 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 13, 2014), did not involve the testimony of a
party’s employee, but instead involved the testimony of a non-party at an arbitration hearing.
Id. at *1-2.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, Defendants’ motion should be denied.
