UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA
IN RE: XARELTO (RIVAROXABAN)
PRODUCTS LIABILITY LITIGATION

MDL No. 2592
SECTION L

THIS DOCUMENT RELATES TO:

JUDGE ELDON E. FALLON

Joseph Orr, Jr., et al. v. Janssen et al.
Case No. 2:15-cv-03708

MAGISTRATE NORTH

DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO QUASH SUBPOENA FOR SANJAY JALOTA TO
APPEAR AND TESTIFY AT A HEARING OR TRIAL IN A CIVIL ACTION
Defendants Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc., Bayer Pharma AG, Janssen
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Janssen Research & Development, LLC, (collectively, “Defendants”)
respectfully request that this Court quash the Plaintiffs’ Subpoena to Sanjay Jalota to Appear and
Testify at Hearing or Trial in a Civil Action. The subpoena is invalid because it requires the witness,
who is an employee of Defendants, and who both lives and works more than 100 miles from the
courthouse and outside of Louisiana, to testify by contemporaneous transmission from a different
location in an effort to circumvent the Federal Rules’ geographic limits on compelling live trial
testimony.

Respectfully submitted,
