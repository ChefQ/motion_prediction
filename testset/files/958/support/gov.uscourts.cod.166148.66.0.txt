Civil Action No. 16-cv2495-MJW

MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF ORDER
Defendant Dollar Phone Corp. (“DPC”), by and through its undersigned counsel, for its
Motion For Reconsideration of this Court’s Order on Motion to Dismiss or Transfer Venue,
Docket Number 65 (the “Order”) (Exhibit A hereto), states as follows:
Pre Motion Conference as Per Local Rules
1. DPC’s undersigned counsel conferred with Michael Davis, Esq., new counsel to Nationwide
Telecom Incorporated (“Nationwide”) via email communications on September 27 and 28,
2017 concerning DPC’s motion for reconsideration, based on the Court’s presumption that
Nationwide’s switch is located in Colorado, when it is not, and sought consent to this motion.
2. Michael Davis, Esq. responded by email on September 28, 2017 that Nationwide does not
consent to the relief sought in this motion.

Case 1:16-cv-02495-MSK-MJW Document 66 Filed 09/28/17 USDC Colorado Page 2 of 5

The Order Presumes Nationwide’s Los Angeles, CA Switch is Located in Colorado
3. DPC moves for reconsideration and or renewal, or alternatively pursuant to Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 60(b) for relief from this Court’s Order, dated September 18, 2017 (the
“Order”) in order to correct manifest injustice.
4. The Order presumed that Nationwide Telecom’s switch(es) that allegedly was accessed by
DPC was accessed in Colorado – a fact which was never alleged by Nationwide. In view of
Nationwide never having made this allegation, DPC therefore was not on notice it needed to
brief and present this factual issue for the Court on the prior motion to dismiss.
5. The Court found specific jurisdiction based on a presumption that because neither side stated
where Nationwide’s wholesale switch was located, that therefore the Court would presume
the wholesale switch was in Colorado. As the Court stated (Order at p. 7):
Neither side has identified the physical location of the wholesale
switch owned by Nationwide and accessed by Dollar Phone, but
the Court construes the Amended Complaint’s allegation that
“Nationwide’s business is within the territorial boundaries of . . .
Colorado” to assert that Nationwide maintains equipment of this
type in Colorado. Thus, it appears that Dollar Phone made a form
of electronic contact with property belonging to Nationwide in
Colorado.
6. As set forth in the accompanying declaration of David Klein, a consultant for DPC,
Nationwide’s wholesale switch(es) DPC is alleged to have accessed is(are) located in Los
Angeles, California.
7. DPC did not have notice of a need to present this factual information to the Court earlier in
its motion papers because Nationwide did not anywhere allege, neither in its pleading nor in
its opposition to the motion to dismiss, that its wholesale switch was located in Colorado.

Case 1:16-cv-02495-MSK-MJW Document 66 Filed 09/28/17 USDC Colorado Page 3 of 5

Clearly it is not. Only the Court in its Order (at p. 7) made this presumption of a fact never
alleged by Nationwide, and which presumption is not correct factually.
8. Thus, it would be a manifest injustice if this Court were to require DPC to go to trial in
Colorado to show the easily demonstrable, undisputed fact (which was never alleged by
Nationwide) that Nationwide’s switch(es) is(are) not located in Colorado, but are located in
Los Angeles, California.
9. In view of this factual information, the Court should find there is no specific jurisdiction over
DPC based on alleged accessing electronically of Nationwide’s switch(es) locate in Los
Angeles, California.
10. While the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not explicitly recognize a motion for
reconsideration, Federal Rule 60(b) allows a litigation to seek relief from an order.
11. DPC should be granted relief from the Order because the Court miscomprehended a fact
never alleged by Nationwide, namely the location of Nationwide’s wholesale switch.

12. WHEREFORE, for the reasons set forth above, Defendant Dollar Phone Corp. respectfully
requests that the Court grant Defendant’s Motion for reconsideration of the Order, and that
upon reconsideration the Court Grant DPC’s motion to dismiss, or in the alternative transfer
venue to the Eastern District of New York, and grant Defendant such other and further relief
as is just, proper and equitable.
