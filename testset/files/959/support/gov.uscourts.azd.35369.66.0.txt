CV03-2345 PHX VAM
CLAIMANTS’ MOTION TO
STAY EXECUTION OF JUDGMENT
PENDING APPEAL
(Hearing Requested)

Claimants, through counsel and pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62(d)

19

and 28 U.S.C. §1355(c), hereby request that this court enter an order staying the execution

20

of judgment in this matter during the pendency of the appeal to be taken by the claimants.

21

The judgment in this matter has been automatically stayed under Rule 62(a) for 10

22
23

days. That stay will expire on February 2, 2006 unless extended by this court. As a

24

general rule a stay requires the appealing party to post a supersedeas bond in order to

25

secure the interest of the prevailing party. Yet a supersedeas bond is used to secure a

26
27
28

money judgment. Here, the Government has not obtained a money judgment. Rather the
Government has obtained a judgment authorizing it to take title to property that it already
possesses.

28 U.S.C. §1355(c) controls the nature of a stay involving forfeited property.
In any case in which a final order disposing of property in a civil forfeiture action or
proceeding is appealed, removal of the property by the prevailing party shall not deprive
the court of jurisdiction. Upon motion of the appealing party, the district court or the
court of appeals shall issue any order necessary to preserve the right of the appealing
party to the full value of the property at issue, including a stay of the judgment of the
district court pending appeal or requiring the prevailing party to post an appeal bond.

In the present case, the only order necessary to achieve the goal of 28U.S.C.
§1355(c) to preserve “the full value of the property at issue” is an order that the
Government not execute the judgment during the pendency of the appeal.
RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED January 26, 2006.
