DEFENDANT QUALCOMM INCORPORATED’S REPLY
BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF ITS REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
OF MATTERS RELEVANT TO ITS RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO
MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE A SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT
In opposing Qualcomm’s Request for Judicial Notice of the 3GPP Working
Procedures and Qualcomm’s Comments in response to the FCC’s Interoperability Petition,
Cellular South1 does not argue that these documents are not matters of public record or that they
are “subject to reasonable dispute” within the meaning of Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). In fact, Cellular
South concedes the authenticity of the documents. Cellular South’s opposition to the Request is
instead based on the contention that Qualcomm is asking this Court to take judicial notice of the
truth of the contents of the documents and that judicial notice is not permissible for such
purpose. For the reasons set forth below, Cellular South’s opposition is without merit, and this
Court may take judicial notice of the documents and consider them in determining whether to
permit the filing of the proposed Second Amended Complaint.

We refer to the plaintiffs collectively as “Cellular South”.

1. 3GPP Working Rules
Cellular South admits that the 3GPP Working Procedures “may” be judicially
noticed for “what they say”. See Pls.’ Opp’n to Def. Qualcomm’s Request for Judicial Notice
(“CS Opp’n”), at 4, ECF No. 118. Cellular South argues, however, that the contents of the 3GPP
Working Procedures have no relevance to the Motion for Leave unless this Court takes judicial
notice of truth of the contents of the document, and that such use is not permissible. Id.
However, a specific statement within a document, as well as the authenticity of the document
itself, may be judicially noticed if the statement is “not subject to reasonable dispute”. Cellular
South’s response does not dispute that the document provided as Exhibit A to Qualcomm’s
Response in Opposition to Cellular South’s Motion for Leave to Amend, ECF No. 111, is a true
and correct copy of the published Working Procedures of 3GPP. Consequently, this Court,
presented with a document that is conceded to be an authentic statement of 3GPP Working
Procedures, can certainly find that it is not subject to reasonable dispute that a particular rule
stated therein—such as the rule that each member company is entitled to only one vote—is
actually a rule of procedure followed by 3GPP in its standards-setting process.
Cellular South relies principally on Lovelace v. Software Spectrum, Inc., 78 F.3d
1015 (5th Cir. 1996). Lovelace held that, while the court, in ruling on a 12(b)(6) motion, could
take judicial notice of SEC filings for proof that certain statements were or were not made in
such filings, the court could not take judicial notice of the truth of statements contained in the
filings in order to resolve a disputed fact. Lovelace, 78 F.3d at 1018. That holding is not
remarkable, because the truth of statements contained in an SEC filing could still be “reasonably
subject to dispute”. However, Lovelace and the other cases cited by Cellular South that rely on
Lovelace are of no help to Cellular South, because, in contrast to statements in SEC filings, the
3GPP rules are not statements that are true or false, but rather are statements of policy. They

have no substance beyond “what they say”, and they do not purport to “prove” or “disprove” any
fact. Accordingly, Qualcomm is not offering the document to prove the “truth” of the rules, but
rather that such rules are in place, and it is not reasonably subject to dispute that 3GPP rules
permit each member company only one vote regardless of the number of representatives it has
present.
Furthermore, the undisputed existence of this “one member, one vote” rule is
relevant because it tends to make the allegation that the defendants manipulated the standardssetting process implausible, and it establishes that this case is not analogous to Allied Tube, as
Cellular South argues. Cellular South relies on Allied Tube in the proposed Second Amended
Complaint for the argument that their allegations permit a plausible inference that the 3GPP
proceedings were manipulated to create Band 17. See Mem. of Law in Supp. of Pls.’ Mot. for
Leave, at 10, ECF No. 106. But putting aside the fact that Cellular South has not alleged that the
defendants engaged in vote-packing as was done in Allied Tube, the 3GPP rule that members
have only one vote makes it implausible that any company could have “packed” meetings even if
it tried to. See Def. Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for Leave (“QC Opp’n”), at 11-12, 12 n.3, ECF No. 112.
This Court may therefore take judicial notice of the 3GPP Working Procedures in connection
with Qualcomm’s Opposition to Leave to Amend.
2. Qualcomm’s Petition Comments
As to Qualcomm’s Comments in response to the Interoperability Petition, Cellular
South opposes judicial notice by arguing that Qualcomm seeks to use the statements made in its
Comments to disprove Cellular South’s allegations that interference does not exist. See CS
Opp’n at 5. But Qualcomm is not seeking to use the Comments for that purpose. Rather, the
portion of the Comments cited in Qualcomm’s brief opposing Cellular South’s Motion for Leave
to Amend is offered to show the lack of plausibility of Cellular South’s assertion that
1083234

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 119 Filed: 11/15/12 4 of 7 PageID #: 3902

Qualcomm’s decision to produce Band 12 chips supports an inference that interference concerns
expressed by Qualcomm were pretextual rather than sincere. Cellular South’s inference depends
on the assumption that Qualcomm would only undertake to produce Band 12 chips if they would
not be subject to interference. See QC Opp’n at 21 n.11. Cellular South’s inference is rendered
implausible by the fact that Qualcomm did not previously contend either that Band 12 devices
could not be produced or that Band 12 chips would be interference-free. That implausibility is
demonstrated by, among other things, Qualcomm’s statements in the Comments, in which
Qualcomm acknowledged that Band 12 devices could be produced with the use of wider filters,
but nonetheless expressed concerns that Band 12 devices would be subject to interference
because they must use wider—and therefore less effective—filters. See id.
Cellular South also argues that pretext is shown in the FCC’s Notice of Proposed
Rule Making (“NPRM”), which, according to Cellular South, “rejected” statements about
interference allegedly made by Qualcomm in its Comments. See Pls.’ Proposed Second Amd.
and Supp. Compl., at ¶ 269, ECF No. 105-1. As explained in Qualcomm’s brief opposing leave
to amend, Cellular South claimed that Qualcomm raised “concerns regarding base station
filtering”, but the cited portion of the Comments shows that Qualcomm actually raised concerns
about filtering in devices. See QC Opp’n at 20-21 & n.10. Judicial notice of what Qualcomm
said in this document therefore shows that Cellular South has mischaracterized the NPRM—the
NPRM simply did not “reject” Qualcomm’s assertions about interference.
For these reasons, Cellular South’s objections to this Court taking judicial notice
of the 3GPP Working Procedures and Qualcomm’s Petition Comments are without merit.
Accordingly, this Court should grant Qualcomm’s request to take judicial notice of the
documents and consider them in connection with Cellular South’s Motion for Leave to file a
Second Amended Complaint.
