PLAINTIFF GAURAV TANEJA’S OPPOSITION TO THE MOTION OF LAWRENCE
ROUGIER FOR CONSOLIDATION OF RELATED ACTIONS
Plaintiff Gaurav Taneja (“Taneja”) respectfully submits this memorandum of law in
opposition to the motion of Lawrence Rougier (“Rougier”) (Dkt. No. 67, the “Motion”).
Although Taneja does not oppose consolidation, Taneja requests that this Court deny
Rougier’s request to strike the November 30, 2018 lead plaintiff deadline triggered by notice of
the Taneja Action.1 Taneja has concerns regarding Rougier’s position as lead plaintiff in light of
his Proposed Second Consolidated Class Action Complaint (“Proposed SAC”), which
significantly expands the class period and asserts new theories of liability.2 Counsel for Taneja
believes that the Court should see whether any movant comes forward and allow any such potential
lead plaintiff to respond to Rougier’s Motion and request to file a further amended complaint (Dkt.
No. 68). See 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(i) & (ii) (directing courts to appoint the “most adequate
plaintiff” as lead plaintiff after consolidation); In re Cyberonics Inc. Sec. Litig., 468 F. Supp. 2d
936, 940 (S.D. Tex. 2006) (reconsidering the appointment of lead plaintiff because “additional

claims give rise to the possibility that a more appropriate lead plaintiff exists, a party which was
not apprised of its inclusion in the lawsuits by the original notice”); see also Dube v. Signet
Jewelers Ltd., No. 16-CV-6728-JMF, 2017 WL 1379385, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 14, 2017) (similar).
Rougier now seeks to represent a significantly broader class than the one proposed in the
initial complaint (Dkt. No. 1, the “Initial Complaint”) that he was appointed to represent. After the
Initial Complaint was filed, a PSLRA notice was published that identified a class period
encompassing only 16 trading days, running from July 13, 2017 to August 3, 2017. See Dkt. No.
9-5.3 Lead plaintiff applications were submitted, and the Court appointed Rougier as the lead
plaintiff because he was the individual movant with the largest financial interest in the three-week
class period. See Dkt. No. 44. However, the Proposed SAC will assert a class period of eightynine weeks, spanning February 23, 2017 to November 7, 2018—more than 26 times the length of
the original class period—and encompassing many investors who did not have the opportunity to
seek leadership in response to notice of the Initial Complaint. As such, investors that purchased in
the expanded period should be afforded the right to respond to Rougier’s Motion and Rougier’s
request to file the Proposed SAC. See Signet, 2017 WL 1379385, at *1 (reconsidering the
appointment of lead plaintiff when an amended complaint expanded the class period from January
7, 2016 – June 3, 2016, to August 29, 2013 – February 27, 2017, 8.5 times the length of the original
class period).

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (“PSLRA”) requires a notice to be published with
20 days of the filing of the complaint, informing members of the purported plaintiff class “of the
pendency of the action, the claims asserted therein, and the purported class period” and “that, not
later than 60 days after the date on which the notice is published, any member of the purported
class may move the court to serve as lead plaintiff of the purported class.” 15 U.S.C. § 78u4(a)(3)(A)(i).
3

Moreover, through the Proposed SAC, which will purportedly encompass the allegations
of the Taneja Action, Rougier now seeks to litigate new claims on behalf of the class based on
misrepresentations regarding manufacturing quality controls. See Taneja Action, Dkt. No. 1, ¶7
(alleging that “certain of the Company’s lasers were susceptible to fail prematurely”). These were
not claims, however, that Rougier was originally appointed to prosecute. In fact, the Initial
Complaint and original PSLRA notice only informed potential lead plaintiff movants of claims
that the Company failed to disclose that “a major customer was reducing its purchases of the
Company’s 40G receivers” and that this “would have a severe negative impact on the Company’s
financial performance.” See Dkt. No. 1, Dkt. No. 9-5. As such, other potentially more adequate
plaintiffs should be afforded the opportunity to respond, since “the [Proposed] Second Amended
Complaint alters dramatically the gravamen of the claims alleged against Defendants.” Signet,
2017 WL 1379385, at *1.
Finally, Rougier’s previously-filed certification (Dkt. No. 9-2) evidences one purchase and
one sale of AOI securities (Dkt. No. 9-3), but is silent as to any other transaction Rougier may
have executed during the proposed expanded class period. Based on the record, Rougier purchased
15,000 shares of AOI securities on August 3, 2017 and sold 15,000 shares of AOI securities on
August 9, 2017. See Dkt. No. 9-4. Because Rougier’s certification was filed based on the original
three-week class period asserted in the Initial Complaint and has not been updated since then, there
is no information regarding Rougier’s transactions in the nearly twenty-one-month class period to
be asserted in the Proposed SAC, nor any information as to whether Rougier may have had a gain
rather than a loss in the expanded class period. Without such information, it is not possible to
determine whether Rougier is subject to unique defenses, such as a lack of standing. See 15 U.S.C.
§ 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii) (directing courts to appoint a lead plaintiff that will “adequately protect the

4

interests of the class,” and who is not “subject to unique defenses that render such plaintiff
incapable of adequately representing the class” and providing a presumption that the most adequate
plaintiff is the plaintiff that “has the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class”).
As such, Taneja requests that this Court deny Rougier’s request to strike the November 30,
2018 lead plaintiff deadline triggered by notice of the Taneja Action.
