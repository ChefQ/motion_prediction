RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO LAWRENCE ROUGIER’S
MOTION FOR CONSOLIDATION OF RELATED ACTIONS

Plaintiff Stephen McGrath (“McGrath”), through counsel, respectfully files this Response in
Opposition to Lawrence Rougier’s (“Rougier”) Motion for Consolidation of Related Actions (ECF
No. 67).
Rougier is the Lead Plaintiff in Mona Abouzied v. Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. et al, No.
4:17 Civ. 02399 (the “Abouzied Action”). The Abouzied Action was commenced on August 5, 2017,
alleging a class period of February 23, 2017, to February 21, 2018. Briefing on the Motion to
Dismiss the First Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint (ECF No. 48) was completed on
May 21, 2018.
McGrath filed his Class Action Complaint on October 18, 2018, alleging violations of federal
securities laws relating to Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.’s misrepresentations and omissions
regarding product quality issues with certain transceivers. McGrath alleges a class period of
August 7, 201,8 to September 27, 2018. Two other actions, captioned above, were also filed alleging
similar misrepresentations and omissions during the same time period. The deadline for these parties
to file lead plaintiff motions is November 30, 2018.

McGrath opposes both Rougier’s request that the Court strike the PSLRA lead plaintiff
deadline and consolidation of the actions until after a lead plaintiff is appointed for alleged
misrepresentations and omissions relating to the August 7, 2018 to September 27, 2018 class
period. After such appointment, the then-appointed lead plaintiff should be permitted to respond
to Rougier’s motion for consolidation.
DATED: November 28, 2018.
Respectfully submitted,
