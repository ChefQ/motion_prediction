2

Court-appointed Lead Plaintiff Lawrence Rougier (“Rougier” or “Lead Plaintiff”),
respectfully moves this Court for entry of the attached [Proposed] Order: (1) consolidating Taneja
v. Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. et al., Case No. 4:18-cv-03544-SL (S.D. Tex.) (the “Taneja
Action”), Pokoik v. Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. et al., Case No. 4:18-cv-03722-LR (S.D Tex.),
and McGrath v. Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. et al., Case No. 4:18-cv-03914-LR (S.D Tex.)
(altogether the “Related Actions”), with the above-captioned consolidated securities class action
(the “Consolidated Securities Action”)1 pursuant to Rule 42(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure; (2) striking the November 30, 2018 lead plaintiff deadline purportedly triggered by the
notice of pendency of the Related Actions, published on October 1, 2018 (the “Taneja Notice”);
(3) declaring any motions to be filed seeking appointment as lead plaintiff in response to the Taneja
Notice ineffective; (4) requiring republication of a corrected notice explaining that a lead plaintiff
has already been appointed as of January 22, 2018; and (4) granting such further relief as the Court
may deem just and proper.
This Motion is based on the accompanying Memorandum of Law in support thereof, the
Declaration of Jamie McKey filed herewith, the pleadings and other filings herein, the [Proposed]
Order attached hereto, and any such other written or oral argument as may be permitted by the
Court.
Respectfully submitted,
