PLAINTIFF’S MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION IN LIMINE TO
EXCLUDE TESTIMONY BY DEFENDANTS’ EXPERTS
DEBORAH MASH, CHARLES WETLI, AND GARY DIAS
Plaintiff submits this Memorandum in support of her motion for an order
excluding the testimony at trial of Defendants’ experts Deborah Mash, Ph.D., Charles
Wetli, M.D., and Gary Dias. Plaintiff requests that the Court conduct a preliminary
hearing at which Defendants will have the burden of proving that Deborah Mash and
Charles Wetli are qualified and that their opinions are scientifically and medically
reliable. Plaintiff also seeks an Order excluding the testimony of Gary Dias on the
grounds that it does not appear that he is qualified and his opinion addresses issues
that are questions of law for the Court to decide.
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff filed this motion in limine at the suggestion of the Court, notwithstanding
that Defendants have the burden of qualifying their experts under Daubert v. MerrellDow Pharmaceuticals, 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786 (1993), and its progeny, as
codified in Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. However, Defendants have not

disclosed the grounds upon which they seek to qualify these experts and their opinions,
and the reports of Deborah Mash and Charles Wetli do not even attempt to address the
admissibility requirements of Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Apparently,
Defendants intend to make the required showing at the preliminary hearing or at trial.
Yet without this information, Plaintiff cannot in the motion in limine anticipate much less
address the grounds upon which Defendants will seek to qualify their experts and their
opinions. Thus, i n this motion in limine, Plaintiff can only point out some of the glaring
inadequacies that are apparent from Defendants’ experts’ reports, and reserve the right
to fully address all issues when Defendants seek to meet their burden of proving
admissibility at the preliminary hearing.
PLAINTIFF’S EXPERT SUBMISSIONS RELATED TO THE MOTION IN LIMINE
Plaintiff’s experts who have offered opinions that are relevant to the testimony of
Deborah Mash and Charles Wetli are: (1) Peter Gillespie, M.D., who was the medical
examiner who performed the autopsy upon Mark Jackson and concluded that the death
was a homicide; (2) Kevin Brown, M.D., who is board-certified in emergency medicine;
and, (3) Debra Pinals, M.D., who is a board-certified psychiatrist. Drs. Gillespie and
Brown have submitted two reports and Dr. Pinals submitted one report, all of which
have been produced to Defendants pursuant to Rule 26.
Dr. Gillespie summarizes his initial opinion as follows:
It is my opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty,
that the cause of death for Mr. Jackson was sudden cardiac
death (SCD). It is also my opinion that his death more likely
than not was due to a ventricular arrhythmia. The factors
which caused the arrhythmia were fixed cardiac structural
abnormalities and the enhanced activation of his
sympathetic nervous system resulting from the altercation
with the police from the West Warwick Police Department on
the night of June 27, 2008.

Tab A.1
Dr. Gillespie has also submitted a report in rebuttal to the reports of Deborah
Mash and Charles Wetli. His opinion is summarized as follows:
In my opinion expressed to a reasonable degree of medical
certainty, Mark Jackson did not experience “excited delirium
syndrome” (“EDS”) prior to his death and “excited delirium
did not cause his death.
To consider a diagnosis of EDS, there must be, at a
minimum, a presence of both “delirium” and an “excited”
state. “Delirium” is a medical term of art characterized by a
disturbance in consciousness and a change in cognition.
This disturbance typically develops over hours to days and
tends to fluctuate during the day. The disturbance in
consciousness means a reduced understanding of one’s
environment. The cognition change often means memory
impairment, disorientation to place or time, or an impaired
ability to articulate speech or name objects.
The “excited” behavior observed in the case studies typically
involves a witnessed state of agitation, restlessness, acts of
violence, delusions, rambling speech, or combative behavior
that leads a witness to contact legal or medical personnel for
intervention.
****
Jackson’s behavior including the strength he manifested in
resisting the officers’ use of force is consistent with the
normal stress responses of a very frightened, very large,
mentally ill person rather than excited delirium. His
continuing to resist after pepper spray and baton strikes to
his legs is also consistent with panic and fear for his life.
****

The reports and Curriculum Vitae of Deborah Mash, Charles Wetli, and Gary Dias (report only) and
Plaintiff’s experts are attached to the Affidavit of Stephen P. Sheehan sworn to on February 3, 2011, and
are referred to herein by the tab reference in said affidavit. All of the reports of Plaintiffs’ experts are
certified pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746 and, therefore, should be considered in connection with the motion
pursuant to Rule 43(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (“the court may hear the matter on
affidavits”).

3

By definition, a classification of EDS is dependent on an
autopsy that provides no clear cause of death. EDS is
essentially a diagnosis of exclusion, potentially appropriate
only where there is no other explanation for the cause of
death. The Dimaio text on EDS categorically states at page
69:
Excited delirium syndrome involves the sudden death of an
individual during or following an episode of excited delirium,
in which an autopsy fails to reveal evidence of sufficient
trauma or natural disease to explain the death.
That is not the case here. The autopsy did not exclude other
explanations than EDS for the cause of death. To the
contrary, the autopsy showed indisputable cardiac lesions
and o ther cardiac abnormalities which are universally
recognized to cause and contribute to sudden cardiac death
(“SCD”). The diagnosis of Drs. Mash and Wetli of EDS in
this case, when the autopsy shows positive evidence to
explain the cause of death, is completely contrary to the
accepted pathological standards for determining cause of
death. This is not an issue upon which pathologists may
reasonably differ.
Tab C.
Dr. Brown prepared an initial and a rebuttal report. His initial opinion is
summarized as follows:
Jackson’s pre-existing heart disease and mental health
history, coupled with the altercation itself (which from all
accounts was intense and certainly resulted in an increased
heart rate and elevated blood pressure) more likely than not
caused a stress on his abnormal heart leading to SCD
[sudden cardiac death], consistent with the autopsy report.
In my opinion the SCD would not have occurred if Jackson
had not been in the physical altercation with the police.
****
It is my opinion that had Kelley, Lukowicz, and Thornton
acted in conformity with their knowledge and training (as
discussed above), then CPR could and should have been
started immediately at or near the time of Jackson’s arrival at
the station (23:10:29), or about 4:20 sooner than happened
here. Under such a scenario, at a minimum, the AED would

4

have been started by about 23:12:20, or about 3:30 earlier
than happened here. It is my opinion that under such a
scenario, Jackson more probably than not would have
recovered.
****
Early CPR helps preserve the heart’s electrical arrhythmia
in, for example, VF. Untreated, VF and VT deteriorates into
a total lack of cardiac activity termed asystole and death
within minutes. By the time the rescue personnel attempted
the AED here, Jackson was asystole. He briefly registered a
VF rhythm en route to the hospital in the Fire Rescue
ambulance. Based on the above, I believe that had CPR
and AED been started earlier, Jackson more probably than
not would have recovered.
Tab D.
Dr. Brown also p repared a rebuttal report. That opinion is summarized as
follows:
At your request, I read the reports of Drs. Wetli and Mash. I
disagree with their conclusions. Mark Jackson did not
experience “excited delirium syndrome” (ExDS) prior to his
death. Accordingly, he clearly did not die from ExDS.
****
Assuming that ExDS can be a valid cause of death, it is
indisputable that not all deaths that occur suddenly in police
custody are caused by excited delirium. To the contrary, in
cases that attributed ExDS as the cause of death, an
autopsy has failed to reveal evidence of a clear cause of
death such as sufficieint trauma or natural disease to explain
the death. In other words, the classification of ExDS is
dependent on an autopsy that provides no clear cause of
death and thus ExDS is essentially a diagnosis of exclusion,
potentially appropriate only where there is no other
explanation for the cause of death.
That is not the case here with Mr. Jackson. Sudden cardiac
death (SCD) is a medically recognized cause of death. As
previously referred to in my earlier report, the cardiac
abnormalities and struggle with the police present more than
sufficient evidence to support SCD as the cause of death for
Mr. Jackson.

5

****
Notably, the case studies of ExDS involve individuals
already in a state of delirium when approached by police or
mental health provider. Unlike these cases, here it was the
police officers themselves who triggered a response from
Jackson. Jackson did not exhibit any signs of violence,
agitation, delusions, etc. that caused the police or medical
personnel to intervene. Jackson’s response – walking away
from the officers in response to commands of “stop” and
having spotlights shone on him, and stating “You’re not the
boss of me” – does not rise to the level of “excited” or
“delirium” required for an ExDS diagnosis. Instead, such
behavior is consistent with a mentally ill person’s stress
response. Jackson’s use of the phrase “I love you guys” is
consistent with his peaceable nature (as described by
witnesses below) and with a fear of the police, rather than
delirium.
Jackson’s’ behavior including the strength he manifested in
resisting the officers’ use of force is consistent with the
normal stress responses of a very frightened, very large,
mentally ill person rather than excited delirium. His
continuing to resist after pepper spray and baton strikes to
his legs is also consistent with panic and fear for his life.
****
It is not possible to diagnose ExDS here chiefly on the fact
that, over five minutes after Jackson had arrived at the
station, he was found to be in asystole. This is because
asystole (ECG showing a flat-line) is, of course, the final end
state of no cardiac electrical activity regardless of any
preceding cardiac rhythm. The fact that Jackson was in
asystole more than five minutes after arriving at the station is
not the same as stating that Jackson first went into asystole
immediately following his collapse. While the initial detected
cardiac rhythm was no t a shockable rhythm as assessed by
an AED – this likely was because the AED was not applied
for at least five minutes from the time of arrival at the station
and in that period it may have missed the shockable VF
rhythm.
Tab E.

Dr. Pinals also submitted a rebuttal report. Her opinion is summarized
as follows:
In my opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty,
Mr. Mark Jackson was not experiencing any atypical mental
state from his usual presentation prior to his encounter with
the police on 6/27/08. It is further my opinion that the data
available supports that Mr. Jackson acted consistent with his
social and psychiatric history when he attempted to walk
away from the police and then resisted their efforts to forcibly
restrain him.
****
Excited delirium is often reported in the literature to be
associated primarily with cocaine or other stimulant use but
also may be seen with other drug or psychiatric medication
involvement or withdrawal from substances. None of these
conditions were present at the time of Mr. Jackson’s death.
Also, his seeming “intoxication” and bizarre statements were
consistent with how he interacted with the world. Officer
Kelly recognized him as an “EDP” by the time they were
bringing Mr. Jackson back to the station, further supporting
that something about his presentation seemed unusual to an
observer, though it was consistent with prior observations of
him as noted in medical records and witness statements,
rather than an acute change that would be seen with
delirium.
Tab F.
SUMMARY OF EXPERT TESTIMONY TO BE EXCLUDED
Deborah Mash
Deborah Mash summarizes her opinions as follows:
Based on my review of the information provided to me in this
matter, as well as my professional education, experience
and background, it is also my opinion to a reasonable
degree of medical probability that Mr. Jackson was in a state
of excited delirium on June 27, 2008. Most individuals who
experience excited delirium die at the scene or in immediate
police custody or shortly thereafter despite medical

7

intervention. Those who do survive usually evidence
subsequent metabolic, respiratory, hepatic, renal and
cardiac failure. Mr. Jackson was at risk for fatal excited
delirium because of the lack of proper medication and follow
up care for his underlying psychiatric disease.
Tab H.
Charles V. Wetli
Dr. Wetli summarizes his opinions as follows:
It is therefore my opinion to a degree of reasonable medical
certainty that Mr. Mark Jackson died from excited delirium
which was the result of his untreated schizophrenia by the
mechanism outlined above. For the purposes of death
certification, his underlying heart disease would be listed as
a contributory factor in his death. Since the manner of death
is related to the cause of the excited delirium, it would
properly be listed as “natural” since it was the result of a
natural disease process (viz. schizophrenia). Furthermore,
again within reasonable medical certainty, the pepper spray
and the restrained position did not contribute to his death,
and any allegation that earlier CPR would have altered the
course of events is specious since, once vital signs are lost,
death is the inevitable outcome.
Tab J.
Gary P. Dias
Gary P. Dias has summarized his opinions as follows:
It is my opinion that a Rhode Island police officer has a duty
to render medical aid to anyone who is injured or ill.
“Rendering Aid” is an open-ended term that can encompass
many different options. Those options may include
summoning medical assistance to applying basic first aid to
administering advanced life support. The level of one’s
response is dependent on his/her training and level of
certification and upon one’s assessment of the medical
problem and aid required.
It is my opinion that a Rhode Island police officer does not
have specific duty to administer CPR in an injured/ill person.
If it were a specific duty, it would be mandatory for all police
officers to be trained and certified in CPR and also required

8

to administer first aid and/or CPR on all medical calls for
service to which they responded.
Tab L.
ARGUMENT
I.

Plaintiff’s motion is appropriate under Rules 104 and
702 under the Federal Rules of Evidence

“The Supreme Court clearly held that the scientific validity of expert testimony is
a question that the trial judge must determine pursuant to Rule 104(a).” Wright & Gold,
Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence 2d §6266 (2005), citing Daubert v. MerrellDow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 593, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 2796 (1993). Rule
104(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence states as follows:
Rule 104.

Preliminary Questions

(a) Questions of admissibility generally. Preliminary
questions concerning the qualification of a person to be a
witness, the existence of a privilege, or the admissibility of
evidence shall be determined by the court, subject to the
provisions of subdivision (b). In making its determination it is
not bound by the rules of evidence except those with respect
to privileges.
When the matter is considered at an in limine hearing , “’the trial court may consider,
inter alia, offers of proof, affidavits, stipulations, or learned treatises, in addition to
testimony or other documentary evidence (and, of course, legal argument).’” Oddi v.
Ford Motor Company, 234 F.3d 136, 154, (3rd Cir. 2000), quoting United States v.
Downing , 753 F.2d 1224, 1241 (3rd Cir. 1985).
The criteria to be addressed are set forth in Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence:
Rule 702.

Testimony of Experts

If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will
assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to
9

determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by
knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may
testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the
testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the
testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,
and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods
reliably to the facts of the case.
See Advisory Committees Notes to the 2000 Amendments to F.R.E. 702 (“The
amendment makes clear that the sufficiency of the basis of the expert’s opinion is to be
decided under Rule 702.”).
II.

Defendants have the burden of proving that their experts’
opinions meet the admissibility requirements of F.R.E. 702

The burden of satisfying the requirements of Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence is on the proponent for admission of the experts’ opinion. Hartford Insurance
Co. v. General Electric Co., 526 F.Supp 2d 250, 252 (D.R.I. 2007)(Smith, D.J.), citing
Daubert, 509 U.S. at 592. See Advisory Committee Notes on the 2000 Amendments to
F.R.E. 702 (“[T]he proponent has the burden of establishing that the pertinent
admissibility requirements are met by a preponderance of the evidence.”).
III.

Deborah Mash is not qualified to render the opinion she
offers in this case.

The preliminary determination under Daubert includes the determination of
whether the proffered expert witness is qualified to render the opinion offered in the
particular case. “The court must first ascertain whether the proffered expert has the
educational background or training in a relevant field. Then the court should further
compare the expert’s area of expertise with the particular opinion the expert seeks to
offer and permit the expert to testify only if the expert’s particular expertise enables the
expert to give an opinion that is capable of assisting the trier of fact.” TC Systems, Inc.
v. Town of Colonie, 213 F.Supp.2d 171, 174 (N.D.N.Y. 2002).

10

A threshold issue, therefore, is determining what is the “relevant field” to which
Deborah Mash’s opinion pertains. She purports to diagnose excited delirium and
express an opinion as to the prognosis for Mark Jackson as of June 27, 2008. By
definition, “diagnosis” and an expression of opinion as to “prognosis” are activities in the
field of medicine. Summers v. Missouri Pacific Railroad, 897 F.Supp. 533, 540 (E.D.Ok.
1995); Grenitz v. Tomlian, 858 So.2d 999, 1003 (Fl. 2003). Deborah Mash has a Ph.D.
in pharmacology, but is not a medical doctor. Therefore, she is not qualified to offer the
opinions she expresses in this case. Conde v. Velsicol Chemical Corp., 24 F.3d 809,
813 (6th Cir. 1994) (“non-medical doctors [are] unqualified to render differential
diagnoses of medical conditions”); Plourde v. Gladstone, 190 F.Supp.2d 708, 719 (D.Vt.
2002)(excluding expert with Ph.D. in toxicology from offering opinion on diagnoses of
medical condition); Summers v. Missouri Pacific Railroad, supra; Grenitz v. Tomlian,
supra.
Moreover, it appears that her only training or experience in making such
diagnoses is in cases involving cocaine intoxication and other drug exposure, or on the
basis of microscopic examination of brain tissue, issues which are not involved in this
case. In short, her expertise in the fields of pharmacology, toxicology and post-mortem
analysis of brain tissue does not qualify her to testify in this case, which does not raise
issues within those fields of expertise since Mr. Jackson was not on drugs and no postmortem analysis of brain tissue is available .
IV.

Charles Wetli’s and Deborah Mash’s reasoning and methodology are
not scientifically valid or properly applied to the facts in issue.

As noted above, in this motion in limine, Plaintiff cannot anticipate much less
address the grounds upon which Defendants will seek to qualify their experts under

11

F.R.E. Rule 702. However, a fatal deficiency is already apparent from the reports of
Deborah Mash and Charles Wetli.
Plaintiff has offered the declarations of an emergency physician, Kevin Brown,
M.D. and a pathologist, Peter Gillespie, M.D., that the diagnosis of excited delirium is a
diagnosis of exclusion, which is made only after that there is no evidence of another
disease process that was at work. The reports of Deborah Mash and Charles Wetli do
not address much less dispute that contention. In this case, however, the pathologic
evidence is undisputed that Mr. Jackson had several cardiac anomalies and lesions
which placed him at risk for sudden death. Drs. Gillespie and Brown opine that these
cardiac problems were the cause of death, together with the altercation with the police.
Dr. Wetli and Deborah Mash acknowledge these cardiac findings, and opine that these
lesions were a “contributory cause” for Mr. Jackson’s death. However, they offer no
explanation as to why Mr. Jackson’s cardiac abnormalities and the police altercation
alone (with no excited delirium) are not sufficient to produce this outcome. Accordingly,
their reasoning and methodology is not scientifically valid or properly applied to the facts
in issue in this case. Best v. Lowe’s Home Center, 563 F.3d 171, 179 (6th Cir. 2009)
(expert’s report is inadmissible if he provides no explanation why an alternative cause
was not the sole cause).
V.

Gary P. Dias is not qualified to offer an opinion.

Although defendants have submitted a rebuttal report from Gary P. Dias, they
have not provided a curriculum vitae or other information concerning Mr. Dias’s
qualifications. Accordingly, it is impossible for Plaintiff (or for the Court) to determine if
he is qualified to offer any opinions in this case as an expert.

12

VI.

Gary P. Dias’s opinions are not the proper subject for
expert testimony, but rather pertain to issues of law,
which are for the court to decide.

Gary Dias’s opinions are limited to the issue of “does a Rhode Island police
officer have a duty to render medical aid to an injured/ill person; does a Rhode Island
police officer have a duty to administer CPR to an injured/ill person.” Howe ver, the
question of whether a party owes a duty upon which a duty of care arises is a question
of law for the court to decide. Berman v. Sitrin, 991 A.2d 1038, 1043 (R.I. 2010)(citation
omitted). Accordingly, Mr. Dias’s opinion should be stricken for this reason. National
Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh v. Midwestern General Brokerage, 2007 WL
1529011 (W.D. Mo.) (“[T]he existence of a duty is a question of law for the court to
decide and not the proper subject for expert testimony.”), citing Southern Pine
Helicopters, Inc. v. Phoenix Aviation Managers, Inc., 320 F.3d 838, 841 (8th Cir.
2003)(“expert testimony on legal matters is not admissible”).
CONCLUSION
The opinions offered by Defendants’ experts Deborah Mash, Charles Wetli, and
Gary P. Dias should be excluded.
