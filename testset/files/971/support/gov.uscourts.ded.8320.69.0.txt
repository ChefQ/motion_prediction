INTRODUCTION
Allergan moves to strike Alcon’s motion for summary judgment of non-

infringement and invalidity to the extent it goes beyond the issues on which the Court
gave Defendants permission to move for summary judgment.
The Court gave Alcon extraordinary permission to move for summary judgment
on two specific issues only, one relating to non-infringement and one relating to
invalidity. With respect to invalidity, Alcon sought and was given permission to move
for summary judgment on “ whether the claims of the ‘834 patent violate the written
description requirement of 35 U.S.C. § 112 because they use the term ‘.15%’” (See
Scheduling Order, D.I. 30, at 3-4.)
Much of Alcon’s summary judgment motion, however, focuses not on whether
there is written description support for the “ 0.15% (w/v)” limitation, but whether there is
support for the 0.15% (w/v) concentration being “ therapeutically effective,” as recited in
the preambles of the independent claims. For example, Alcon argues in its summary
judgment motion:
[N]owhere in the specification or the original disclosure of the application from
which the ’834 patent claims priority is 0.15% (w/v) identified as a
therapeutically effective amount of active ingredient.
(Defendants’ Opening Brief, D.I. 55, at 3.) That is an entirely different issue, and it is
one for which Alcon neither sought nor was given permission to raise on summary
judgment.
II.

ARGUMENT
A.

Alcon was Given Permission to Move for Summary Judgment of
Invalidity on the Sole Issue of Whether there is Written Description
Support for the Claimed “0.15% (w/v)” Concentration

As the Court may recall, Alcon argued vigorously for permission to move for
early summary judgment on two specific issues. One was a non-infringement issue
relating to Allergan’ s U.S. Patent No. 6,673,337. The other was an invalidity issue

relating to the ’ 834 patent. Alcon’ s counsel described the invalidity issue at the
November 22, 2004 scheduling conference as follows:
The only issue is looking at the specification, does that support the revised claims
which added the new matter of up to 0.15 percent. . . .We simply want to look at
the claim and the spec and say there is no support for these claims because
nothing in the claim relates to the amount. Indeed, everything in the specification
is .2 percent or higher, every chart, every example. It would only teach one to use
that much. There is nothing there that would even suggest that you would go to a
lower amount.
(Marsden Decl, Ex. A, at 7.)
In a follow-up letter to Allergan, Alcon confirmed the statements it made at the
scheduling conference:
We can confirm that the summary judgment motion that Alcon intends to file be
limited to two arguments: (1) the claims of the ‘834 patent are invalid for lack of
written description under 35 U.S.C. Sec. 112 because there is no support for the
limitation “ up to about 0.15%,” and, . . . .
(Marsden Decl., Ex. B.)
Alcon’ s description of the motion at the hearing on December 15, 2004, was
consistent with its statements at the scheduling conference and in the follow-up letter:
The second motion relates to an allegation of lack of written description about the
term .15 percent. That is obviously a mathematical term. Everybody knows what
.15 percent is. The question is whether or not the claimed limitations that use .15
percent are supported by the specification. . . . That’ s what the summary judgment
process would be about.
(Marsden Decl., Ex. C, at 3.)
Alcon thus clearly and repeatedly represented to the Court and to Allergan that
the issue on which it would seek summary judgment was whether there is support in the
’ 834 patent for the “ 0.15% (w/v)” limitation in the claims. Based on Alcon’ s
representations, the Court agreed to depart from its normal procedure and gave Alcon
permission to file an early summary judgment motion on that issue:
Defendants shall be permitted to file two summary judgment motions to be heard
at the hearing on June 7, 2005. These motions shall be limited to: a) whether the
claims of the ‘834 patent violate the written description requirement of 35 U.S.C.
§ 112 because they use the term “ .15%” ; and b) whether the limitation “ solubility

enhancing component” in the ‘337 patent should be limited to only anionic
solubility enhancing components. . . . Defendants shall be permitted no other
summary judgment motions in this case.
(Scheduling Order, D.I. 30, at 3-4.)
B.

Prior to its Summary Judgment Motion, Alcon Never Raised the
“Therapeutically Effective” Limitation in Connection with its Written
Description Defense

Prior to filing its summary judgment motion, Alcon’ s written description defense
did not rely on the “ therapeutically effective” limitation recited in the independent
claims. For example, in the Paragraph IV certification Alcon sent to Allergan on July 6,
2004, before this suit was filed, Alcon laid out its written description defense in detail.
Noticeably absent was any reference to the “ therapeutically effective” limitation on
which Alcon’ s summary judgment motion now relies so heavily:
The claims of the ‘843 patent are invalid under 35 U.S.C. § 112 for lack of written
description because there is no support in the specification or the claims originally
filed in the parent application for the claim term “ up to about 0.15% (w/v)” or
“ 0.15%.” See, e.g., Tronzo v. Biomet, Inc., 156 F.3d 1154, 1158 (Fed. Cir. 1998).
Allergan did not cite to any disclosure to support the term when it was introduced
by preliminary amendment upon filing of the continuation application.
Furthermore, the specification teaches away from a 0.15% limitation in that all
concentrations of the drug referred to in the specification are 0.2% and higher.
***
Thus, all of the claims of the ‘834 patent are invalid under 35 U.S.C. § 112 first
and second paragraphs because there is no support for the 0.15% limitation in the
specification or in the claims originally filed with the parent application.
***
An invention requiring the 0.15% limitation is new matter unsupported by the
disclosure of the parent application USSN 09/904,018.
(Marsden Decl., Ex. D, at 6-7.)
The same goes for Alcon’ s December 27, 2004, response to Allergan’ s first
interrogatory, which sought the bases for Alcon’ s invalidity contentions:
The claims of the ‘834 patent are invalid under 35 U.S.C. § 112 for lack of written
description because there is no support in the specification or the claims originally
filed in the parent application or the application for the ‘834 patent for the claim
term “ up to about 0.15%(w/v)” , “ about 0.15%(w/v)” or “ 0.15% (w/v).” Allergan
did not cite to any disclosure to support the term when it was introduced by
3

preliminary amendment upon filing of the continuation application. Furthermore,
the specification teaches away from a 0.15% limitation in that all compositions
disclosed in the specification have concentration of drug that is 0.2% (w/v) and
higher. Thus, all of the claims of the ‘834 patent are invalid under 35 U.S.C. §
112 first paragraph because there is no support for the 0.15% (w/v) limitation in
the specification or in the claims originally filed with the parent application.
(Marsden Decl., Ex. E, at 2.) Allergan relied on these statements made by Alcon and
took the discovery necessary to respond to Alcon’ s arguments. Alcon’ s last second
change to a new argument violates the Court’ s Scheduling Order and prejudices Allergan.
C.

Alcon neither Sought nor Received Permission to Move for Summary
Judgment on the “Therapeutically Effective” Issue

Having represented to the Court and to Allergan that it would seek summary
judgment of invalidity on the sole issue of whether there is written description support for
the “ 0.15% (w/v)” limitation, Alcon’ s summary judgment motion now improperly raises
an entirely different issue. Much of the motion focuses not on whether there is written
description support for the “0.15% (w/v)” limitation, as Alcon had represented, but
instead whether there is support for the fact that the claimed “0.15% (w/v)”
concentration is “therapeutically effective.”
For example, Alcon now argues that the ’ 834 patent is invalid on the grounds that:
[N]owhere in the specification or the original disclosure of the application from
which the ’ 834 patent claims priority is 0.15% (w/v) identified as a
therapeutically effective amount of active ingredient.
(Defendants’ Opening Brief, D.I. 55, at 3.) Alcon neither sought nor received permission
to move for summary judgment on this “ therapeutically effective” issue.
It is clear that Alcon had second thoughts about the argument it represented it
would make, and decided to focus on the “ therapeutically effective” issue instead. The
reason is evident: In support of its original argument, Alcon had proffered a claim
construction limiting the claim term “ about 0.15%” to “ 0.1499-0.1501%.” (See Marsden
Decl., Ex. F.) Alcon claimed that, since the specification did not disclose a concentration
in the range of “ 0.1499-0.1501%,” the claims were invalid for lack of written description.
4

Page 7 of 10

(See, e.g., Marsden Decl., Ex. E, at 2.) When it became clear from discovery (including
from the deposition of Alcon’ s own witness, Ramon Espino) that Alcon’ s construction of
“ about 0.15%” was untenable, Alcon was forced to abandon its original claim
construction. (Compare Ex. F with D.I. 53.) Once that happened, Alcon’ s original
written description arguments had to be discarded and a new written description defense
focusing on the “ therapeutically effective” limitation constructed in its place.
As a result, the great majority of the invalidity argument in Alcon’ s summary
judgment brief concerns the “ therapeutically effective” issue, starting at page 18, where
Alcon underlines the term in claim 1 for emphasis. (Id. at 18.) This emphasis permeates
Alcon’ s invalidity argument:
•

The invention claimed in the ’ 834 patent includes a critical 0.15% (w/v)
“ therapeutically effective” concentration of active ingredient that is not
mentioned anywhere in the specification and, indeed, is a wholly different
invention from that described in the specification, which calls for
compositions containing a solubility enhancing component and/or an oxychloro preservative. (Id. at 2-3.)

•

The specification of the ’ 834 patent does not teach a “ therapeutically
effective” amount. (Id. at 21.)

•

Neither solubility study provides any indication as to what concentrations of
active ingredient might be therapeutically effective. (Id. at 22-23.)

•

It is beyond dispute that there is no teaching in the patent that 0.15%
brimonidine tartrate is therapeutically effective. (Id. at 23.)

•

But the portions of the specification to which Allergan referred contained
absolutely no teaching of a therapeutically effective 0.15% brimonidine
tartrate composition. (Id. at 25.)

•

Even if one skilled in the art thought to perform experiments that would
identify 0.15% as a therapeutic concentration of brimonidine . . . . (Id. at 27.)

Indeed, the only portion of Alcon’ s brief that actually makes the argument Alcon
represented it would make appears on pages 27 and 28. The argument on those pages is
based on Purdue Pharma—the case which Alcon indicated would be the basis of its
motion. (Marsden Decl., Ex. A, at 7, 20-21, and 24-25)
5

Alcon’ s summary judgment motion also makes at least passing reference to still
more invalidity arguments which are outside the scope of what was agreed upon. At one
point, Alcon suggests that the ’ 834 patent could be invalid for a best mode violation.
(See Defendants’ Opening Brief, at 26 n. 45, D.I. 55.) At other points, Alcon suggests
that the invention disclosed in the specification must include either a solubility enhancing
component or a preservative. (See, e.g., id. at 21.) These arguments are likewise
improperly raised by Alcon.
D.

The Improper Arguments in Alcon’s Summary Judgment Motion
should be Stricken

Because Alcon failed to live up to the representations it made to secure the
extraordinary opportunity to file its early summary judgment motion, and violated the
Scheduling Order by improperly moving for summary judgment based on the
“ therapeutically effective” issue, and has made other undisclosed invalidity arguments,
the portions of Alcon’ s brief dealing with those issues should be stricken. See Rule 16(f)
(the court may make such orders as are just with regard to a party’ s failure to obey the
scheduling order, including “ striking out pleadings or parts thereof” as provided in Rule
37(b)(2)(C)). While these new arguments are as futile as the one Alcon represented it
would make, it was nevertheless improper for Alcon to raise them in its summary
judgment motion.
III.

CONCLUSION
Accordingly, Allergan respectfully requests the Court to strike the

“ therapeutically effective,” best mode, and solubility enhancing component/preservative
arguments in Alcon’ s summary judgment brief.
