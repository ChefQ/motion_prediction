INTRODUCTION

2

This is defendants' third attempt seeking summary judgment that U.S. Patent No. 4,763,356

3 ("the '356 patent") is invalid in light of various prior art references. This Court already twice denied
4 defendants' motions for summary judgment of invalidity of the '356 patent, including motions based
5 on some of the very same references that defendants again raise now. Ignoring the limited scope of
6 supplemental briefing allowed by this Court, defendants now attempt an end-run around this Court's
7 scheduling and discovery orders by rehashing arguments that were previously rejected or previously
8 excluded. In any event, as before, these arguments fail on the merits, as defendants' have failed to
9 present evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie case of obviousness. Indeed, defendants'
10 arguments ignore critical disputes of fact regarding the disclosures of the prior art references.
11 Defendants have once again failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the '356 is
12 rendered obvious or otherwise invalid in light of the prior art, and their motions for summary
1
13 judgment should be denied.

Ample evidence exists to rebut defendants' various claims of obviousness and—at a

14

15 minimum—demonstrate genuine disputes for trial. For example, Lucent's technical expert for the
16 '356 patent, Mr. Bruce Tognazzini, explains how the various prior art references fail to disclose
17 individual elements of the asserted claims. Indeed, Mr. Tognazzini notes that certain combinations
18 suggested by defendants teach away from the invention of the '356 patent. Mr. Tognazzini also
19 analyzes the scope and content of the prior art, the differences between the prior art and the claimed
20 invention, the level of ordinary skill in the art, and he opines that the invention of the '356 patent was
21 nonobvious. Mr. Tognazzini's opinion is further supported by objective indicia of nonobviousness,
22 including the failure of others to arrive at the invention, the commercial success of the invention, and
23 the licensing of the invention by others. Because more than sufficient evidence therefore exists to
24
25
1

Defendants Microsoft, Gateway, and Dell each separately filed a motion for summary judgment of
invalidity of the '356 patent. As the Court permitted (D.I. # 134), Lucent responds to each of those
27 motions in this single opposition brief.

The Invention of the '356 Patent

Pop-up menus, touch-screen form-entry systems, and other computer data entry tools are
commonly used today in restaurants, stores, hospitals, and in the home in many personal computer
programs. But in 1986, when the '356 patent was filed, such tools were novel and pioneering
inventions. Before that time, computer users would need to manually move between data entry
fields, and manually input data into each field, for example, by using a computer keyboard. (Ex. 1,
'356 Patent col. 1:8-22).

People such as securities traders, sales people, and nurses spent an

inordinate amount of time on a daily basis manually inputting information into electronic forms. Id.
Thus, the inventors of the '356 patent identified a need for more user-friendly and time-saving dataentry interfaces. (Id. at 1:24-48).
As a result, the inventors of the '356 patent conceived of many of the time-saving computer
pop-up windows and overlay data-entry tools that we take for granted today. (Id. at cols. 15-18).
The invention of the '356 patent used graphical displays and menus—like the graphical window
displays used in Microsoft Windows applications today. When the ideas and inventions of the '356
patent first became known, they were received with comments such as "great"—"wonderful"—"I've
never seen this before." (Ex. 2, 1/5/06 Day Dep. at 90:4-7).
Before the invention of the '356 patent, a salesperson would need to enter all of the
information manually, perhaps with a computer keyboard, and the salesperson would have been
required to manually switch between each data entry field. (Ex. 1, '356 Patent col. 1:8-22). The '356
patent specification describes some of the user-friendly and time-saving aspects of the invention
with respect to entering information into this hypothetical automobile sales form:
When a form is first brought up on panel 15, one of the fields in the form is
illustratively highlighted and, in accordance with the invention, the predefined tool
for filling in that field is concurrently displayed illustratively as a window overlaying
the form.

1 (Id. at 3:42-46). To meet these identified needs, the inventors of the '356 patent conceived of a time2 saving form-entry system that uses predefined data entry tools that are associated with respective
3 data information fields. (Id. at cols. 15-18). After pointing to or selecting a field for data entry, the
4 form-entry system allows for the display of a predefined tool that is associated with that field in a
5 separate and overlaying window. Figure 2 (left) shows a hypothetical data-entry form that might be
6 used by an automobile salesperson, and Figure 3 (right) shows a predefined tool—here, a menu—
7 associated with the "Model" field:

Another critical time-saving aspect described in the '356 patent is that the salesperson simply

16 "point[s] to one of the entries" on the pop-up tool "overlay (window)," after which, the form entry
17 system may "bring[] up the corresponding tool" pop-up window predefined for that field. (Id. at
18 3:63-4:2). The '356 patent discloses a "keyboard tool" that can be used to enter text data, and a
19 "number entry tool" that can be used to enter numeric data. (Id. at 4:25; 5:3-5 and Figs. 5 and 7).
20 The '356 patent also discloses other similar tools such as date composition tools. Id. The '356 patent
21 discloses how these tools are used with the hypothetical automobile sales form. The '356 patent
22 discloses that the user may "point" to various fields to bring up the appropriate predefined and
23 associated tool. (Id. at 4:35). Accordingly, when "the user points" at various fields, he may point
24 and select entries such as the "CONVERTIBLE model" automobile. (Id. at 3:64).
25

Likewise, when the "Customer Name" field is pointed to or selected, the form-entry system

26 may bring up the keyboard tool which was the predefined tool associated with that field. (Id. at 5:327 5). The salesperson would then point to the appropriate letters, spell the name, and then point to the
28

"E/S" (enter/skip) key, which would cause the name to be input into the "Customer Name" field.

1 (Id. at 5:12-15). Similarly, the '356 patent discloses a number entry tool that may be used to compose
2 numerical data. (Id. at 4:13-56). For example, when the "Quantity" field is pointed to or selected,
3 the form-entry system may bring up a number entry tool which was the predefined tool associated
4 with that field. Id. The salesperson would then point to the appropriate number, compose a number,
5 and then point to the "E" (enter) or "E/S" (enter/skip) key, which would cause the number to be input
6 into the "Quantity" field. Id. Figures 5 amd 7 below show the keyboard and number entry tools:

Significantly, the '356 patent makes clear that some of the time-saving aspects of the
invention include the ability of the user to (1) "point" to fields to call up the associated predefined
tools in overlaid windows, and (2) "point" to selections on the overlaid tools that cause the selection
to be entered into the appropriate field in the form entry system. (Id. at 3-7).

This Court's Construction of the '356 Patent Claims

In September 2003, this Court heard two days of claim construction arguments to construe
the claims of the '356 patent. On March 1, 2004, the Court issued the following constructions for the
limitations of claim 19, based on the claim language and the intrinsic evidence:

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
The procedural history related to the '356 patent in this case is extensive. Claim construction

for this patent included significant briefing and two days of oral argument in September 2003.
Discovery closed in February 2006, expert reports were submitted in March 2006, and voluminous
summary judgment briefing was filed in early 2007. This Court held lengthy summary judgment
hearings on the issues of invalidity and infringement related to the '356 patent, and decided several

Summary Judgment

Summary judgment is appropriate only when "there is no genuine issue as to any material
fact and . . . the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Caterpillar Inc. v.
Sturman Indus., Inc., 387 F.3d 1358, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 (c)). "The
evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his
favor." Id. (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986)). Where, as here,
"the moving party bears the burden of proof at trial, it cannot obtain summary judgment unless it
presents evidence so compelling that no rational jury would fail to award judgment for the moving
party." United States v. Boyce, 148 F. Supp. 2d 1069, 1080 (S.D. Cal. 2001), aff'd, 36 Fed. Appx.
612 (9th Cir. 2002). Where the evidence presents a close question that could be resolved either way
by a jury, summary judgment should be denied. See Mercedes-Benz of N. Am., Inc. v. Hartford Acc.
& Indem. Co., 974 F.2d 1342 (9th Cir. 1992).
A summary judgment determination must also be guided by the appropriate burden of proof.
If the Court determines that a reasonable jury applying the proper burden of proof — in this case
clear-and-convincing evidence—could find for the non-movant, then there exists a genuine issue of
material fact that precludes granting of summary judgment. See Anderson, 475 U.S. at 255.

Obviousness

Because every patent is presumed valid, accused infringers face a "high burden of showing
invalidity on summary judgment." Schumer v. Lab. Computer Sys., Inc., 308 F.3d 1304, 1315 (Fed.
Cir. 2002). "[A] moving party seeking to invalidate a patent at summary judgment must submit
clear and convincing evidence of invalidity so that no reasonable jury could find otherwise." Eli
Lilly &Co. v. Barr Labs., Inc., 251 F.3d 955, 962 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (emphasis added). If evidence is
presented establishing a prima facie case of invalidity, the non-movant must come forward with
evidence to support a finding of validity, but "the ultimate burden of proving invalidity remains with
the challenger throughout the litigation." Pfizer, Inc. v. Apotex, Inc., 480 F.3d 1348, 1360 (Fed.
Cir.), cert denied, 128 S. Ct. 110 (2007). A claimed invention can be found obvious only "if the
differences between the [claims] and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would
have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art."
35 U.S.C. § 103(a). Obviousness is ultimately a question of law based on underlying determinations
of fact. Forest Labs., Inc. v. Ivax Pharms., Inc., 501 F.3d 1263, 1269 (Fed. Cir. 2007).
Courts have long recognized the need to "guard against slipping into use of hindsight" when
considering whether an invention would have been obvious at the time of the invention. Graham v.
John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383 U.S. 1, 36 (1966) (internal quotations omitted). To combat the
tendency toward hindsight, Graham requires courts to focus on several underlying factual inquiries,
including "four general types, all of which must be considered by the trier of fact: (1) the scope and
content of the prior art; (2) the level of ordinary skill in the art; (3) the differences between the
claimed invention and the prior art; and (4) any objective indicia of nonobviousness." Id. Earlier
this year, the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed the primacy of those factors in determining whether a
patent is invalid for obviousness. See KSR Int'l. Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 127 S. Ct. 1727, 1734 (2007)
(citing Graham, 383 U.S. at 17-18). Indeed, the trier of fact must consider all four of the Graham
factors when assessing obviousness, Forest Labs., 501 F.3d at 1269. Under Graham's fourth factor,
courts are to "look at any secondary considerations that would prove instructive," including

"[R]ejections on obviousness grounds cannot be sustained by mere conclusory statements;

3

4 instead, there must be some articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning to support the
5 legal conclusion of obviousness." KSR, 127 S. Ct. at 1741 (quoting In re Kahn, 441 F.3d 977, 988
6 (Fed. Cir. 2006)). Thus, "the burden falls on the patent challenger to show by clear and convincing
7 evidence that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have had reason to attempt to make the
8 composition or device, or carry out the claimed process, and would have had a reasonable
9 expectation of success in doing so." PharmaStem Therapeutics, Inc. v. ViaCell, Inc., 491 F.3d 1342,
10 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (citing KSR, 127 S. Ct. at 1740). In light of these mandated factual inquiries,
11 "a district court properly may grant summary judgment on obviousness . . . only when the[se]
12 underlying factual inquiries present no lingering genuine issues." Beckson Marine, Inc. v. NFM,
13 Inc., 292 F.3d 718, 723 (Fed. Cir. 2002).
In that regard, the Supreme Court has "acknowledged the importance of identifying 'a reason

14

15 that would have prompted a person of ordinary skill in the relevant field to combine the elements in
16 the way the claimed new invention does' in an obviousness determination." Takeda, 492 F.3d at
17 1356-57 (quoting KSR, 127 S. Ct. at 1731). Accordingly, "a patent composed of several elements is
18 not proved obvious merely by demonstrating that element was, independently, known in the prior
19 art." KSR, 127 S. Ct. at 1731. For example, "combining elements that work together 'in an
20 unexpected and fruitful manner' would not have been obvious." PharmaStem, 491 F.3d at 1360

Defendants misstate the proper legal standard for obviousness, mischaracterize the impact of the
Supreme Court's KSR decision, and gloss over the heavy burden of proof they face on summary
judgment. KSR did not render a sweeping change in the law of obviousness. Rather, KSR
reaffirmed the Graham framework as the touchstone for an obviousness analysis. Takeda Chem.
Indus., Ltd. v. Alphapharm Pty., Ltd., 492 F.3d 1350, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (noting that KSR held
that the Graham factors "still control an obviousness inquiry"); Lucent Techs. Inc. v. Gateway, Inc.,
509 F. Supp. 2d 912, 934 (S.D. Cal. 2007) ("KSR also reaffirmed familiar principles set out in
Graham."). Also contrary to defendants' view, the Supreme Court acknowledged the continued
relevance of the teaching, suggestion, motivation ("TSM") principle. KSR, 127 S. Ct. at 1741.

ARGUMENT: SUMMARY

that claims 19 and 21 of the '356 patent are obvious. Gateway's motion is based on a computer
system referred to as "the Foreign Exchange Front End" ("FXFE").

Significantly, however,

defendants have failed to present the FXFE system as evidence to support its claims—because it was
never reduced to practice or otherwise produced. Instead, defendants rely on (1) a general-purpose,
non-technical, magazine article that purports to describe a version of the FXFE system that was
never commercialized ("the Tyler Article"), and (2) the testimony of the system's developer (Mr.
Long). Microsoft's motion is based on financial software entitled "Your Money Manager." Dell's
motion is based on (1) the Tyler Article and (2) computer software entitled "Home Accountant." As
demonstrated below, each of these motions should be denied.
VI.

ARGUMENT: GATEWAY'S MOTION REGARDING THE FOREIGN
EXCHANGE FRONT END ("FXFE") AND THE TYLER ARTICLE
A.

The Court Should Not Consider the FXFE System or the Tyler Article for
Purposes of Summary Judgment
1.

Gateway Is Attempting an End Run Around this Court's May
15, 2007 Order Striking These References

Glaringly absent from defendants' motion is any mention that this Court has expressly

19 precluded defendants from relying on the Tyler Article and the FXFE system in this case. On the
20 eve of the originally scheduled trial, Gateway disclosed the Tyler Article (and the FXFE system it
21 purportedly describes) and moved for summary judgment, arguing that the references rendered the
22 '356 patent obvious. On May 15, 2007—after having decided to allow supplemental briefing on
23 obviousness in light of KSR—this Court struck the Tyler Article and the FXFE system from this
24 case, and denied as moot Gateway's motion for summary judgment that was based on FXFE. (Ex. 5,
25 May 15, 2007 Order Striking Tyler and FXFE). In doing so, the Court recognized that defendants
26 had a full and fair opportunity to raise these references earlier in this case—indeed, years ago—and
27 they should not be allowed to circumvent the Court's discovery Order and present new invalidity
28

theories on the eve of trial. Finisar Corp. v. DirecTV Group, Inc., 424 F. Supp. 2d 896, 902-02

1 (E.D. Tex. 2006) ("A party simply can not wait until shortly before trial to prepare its [invalidity]
2 case. Invalidity is an affirmative defense, and the party which does not properly investigate
3 applicable prior art early enough to timely meet disclosure requirements risks exclusion of that
4 evidence.") (emphasis added). In contravention of this Court's May 15, 2007 Order, Gateway has
5 nevertheless again moved for summary judgment of obviousness based on the FXFE system and the
6 Tyler Article. This Court's Order striking these references wholly precludes defendants from relying
7 on the Tyler Article and the FXFE system purportedly described in that article, and Gateway's
8 motion violates the Court's Order by again relying on these references.

Gateway's Arguments Based on § 102(b) and § 102(g) Are
Improper and Violate this Court's Order Regarding the Scope of
Supplemental Summary Judgment

As discussed above, the trial with respect to the '356 patent was days away from beginning

12 when defendants filed a last-minute motion to delay trial by seeking additional obviousness-based
13 discovery in light of the Supreme Court's decision in KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 127 S. Ct. 1727,
14 1739 (2007). The Supreme Court's decision in KSR is limited to the issue of obviousness under 35
15 U.S.C. § 103.

This Court granted defendants' request, but expressly limited the scope of

16 supplemental expert reports and summary judgment briefing to the issue of obviousness. The
17 supplemental briefing was not, therefore, carte blanche for defendants to introduce all-new theories
18 of anticipation on previously disclosed (and stricken) prior art references. Rather, the Court made it
19 perfectly clear that the extraordinary decision to delay trial and allow supplemental briefing was due
20 to the KSR decision and thus limited solely to the issue of obviousness. (Ex. 6, 5/11/07 Hr'g Tr. at
21 62:13-22; Ex. 7, 6/7/07 Scheduling Order re Supplemental Obviousness Discovery). Recognizing
22 the limited scope of the Court's order, each party's supplemental report was limited to obviousness.
23

Despite those limitations, Gateway's motion now makes two entirely new invalidity

24 arguments based, not on obviousness under 35 U.S.C. § 103, but rather on anticipation under 35
25 U.S.C. §§ 102(b) and 102(g). Gateway's new anticipation-based arguments are in no way impacted
26 by or related to the KSR decision, and they are beyond the Court-ordered scope of this supplemental
27 briefing. Defendants cannot raise new invalidity arguments at this stage, and the Court should not
28

now entertain Gateway's new anticipation arguments. Finisar Corp., 424 F. Supp. 2d at 901-02.

1 Indeed, the very fact that defendants present anticipation arguments further emphasizes Lucent's
2 point above—that this Court should enforce its May 15, 2007 Order striking the FXFE system. In
3 other words, if defendants believe that the FXFE system is an anticipation reference, then it was
4 relevant as such throughout the entire discovery period. Gateway should have identified it years
5 ago, not on the eve of trial. See Finisar, 424 F. Supp. 2d at 901-02.

The FXFE System Does Not Anticipate the '356 Patent

should it entertain defendants' anticipation-based arguments. To the extent it does, however, this
Court should deny defendants' motion. Anticipation under Section 102 requires "the presence in a
single prior art disclosure of all elements of a claimed invention arranged as in that claim." Carella
v. Starlight Archery Pro Line Co., 804 F.2d 135, 138 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (internal quotations omitted).
Defendants have not demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the FXFE system
anticipated claims 19 or 21 of the '356 patent.3
1.

14
15

The FXFE System Is Not Prior Art Under Section 102 Because It
Was Not Publicly Used

Defendants argue that there was a sufficient prior public use4 of the FXFE system in the

16 United States because Chemical Bank—the entity that developed the system in the United
17 Kingdom—allegedly demonstrated an unfinished, incomplete, "beta test" and never-commercialized
18
19

3

We also note that summary judgment is inappropriate at this juncture because Lucent has been
denied significant prior-art discovery. See Celotex v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 326 (1986) (recognizing
20
that Rule 56(f) provides non-movants with protection from premature summary judgment motions).
21 Within the last few weeks, defendants identified all-new purported prior art witnesses—but they
have yet to produce them for depositions. Among the witnesses not yet produced for deposition is
22 Mr. Tyler, the author of the Tyler Article discussed above. Accordingly, defendants' motions should
be denied. Id.
23
4 Gateway argues the FXFE system is prior art under section 102(b) and (g). Section 102(b)
24 requires public use of the invention in the United States. Section102(g) requires that the invention
was "made in this country by another inventor." Because the FXFE system was exclusively
25 developed in a foreign country, that showing would require a public use of the invention in the
United States. See, e.g., Holmwood v. Sugavanam, 948 F.2d 1236, 1238 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (requiring
26
reduction to practice in the United States for 102(g) (emphasis added)); see also Ex. 8, 12/10/2007

1 prototype version of the system to an individual (Mr. Tyler) at its New York office. Such a
2 demonstration is insufficient to constitute a public use of the FXFE system—and this Court should
3 determine that there has been no public use of the FXFE system in the United States. Bernhardt,
4 L.L.C. v. Collezione Europa USA, Inc., 386 F.3d 1371, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (trade-show for sixty5 nine customers and reporters insufficient to show public use despite the fact that the invitees did not
6 sign confidentiality agreements); Moleculon Research Corp. v. CBS, Inc., 793 F.2d 1261, 1265-66
7 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (finding insufficient evidence for public use where inventor maintained control of
8 the device and confined the device to his office despite the absence of a confidentiality agreement).
9

As an initial matter, evidence regarding prior public use must be corroborated in order to

10 invalidate. Juicy Whip, Inc. v. Orange Bang, Inc., 292 F.3d 728, 737 (Fed. Cir. 2002); Finnigan
11 Corp. v. ITC, 180 F.3d 1354, 1366-68 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Gateway cannot rely on the uncorroborated
12 testimony of Robert Long, because testimony from an interested witness, paid by defendants,
13 recalling long past events is insufficient to establish public use. See Woodland Trust v. Flowertree
14 Nursery, Inc., 148 F.3d 1368, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 1998); see also Trading Tech. Intern. Inc. v. eSpeed,
15 Inc., 513 F. Supp. 2d 969, 977 (N.D. Ill. 2007) (insufficient corroboration where witness is
16 "represented by defendants' counsel, and/or [is] simply being paid outright by defendants"). Indeed,
17 a witness who testifies to antedating an invention with his own activities is always personally
18 interested, and the need for corroboration takes on "special force" when the witness may be biased in
19 favor of the interested party. Finnigan, 180 F.3d at 1367-69. Here, significant issues exist regarding
20 Mr. Long's bias and credibility: (1) Mr. Long has been hired by the defendants, (2) defendants have
21 paid for his testimony, (3) he is represented by counsel for defendants, (4) his declaration was
22 written by counsel for defendants, and (5) he has not seen the FXFE system in over twenty years.
23 (Ex. 8, 12/10/07 Long Dep. at 63:20-65:6, 83:1-11, 92:9-93:4).
24

Mr. Long's uncorroborated testimony is especially suspect here, where defendants have failed

25 to produce the FXFE system or any technical documentation regarding the system. Finnigan, 180
26 F.3d at 1366 ("[m]ere testimony concerning invalidating activities is received with further
27 skepticism because such activities are normally documented by tangible evidence such as
28

devices . . ."); see also, e.g., TypeRight v. Microsoft, 374 F.3d 1151, 1158 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (reversing

Mr. Long is not a computer code programmer, and was not involved with

3 programming any of the code involved in the FXFE system. (Ex. 8, 12/10/07 Long Dep. at 17:8-10).
4 Indeed, Mr. Long's testimony is of especially dubious value, as he admits that his declaration was
5 written almost entirely by defendants' attorneys, and he had no understanding that many of the terms
6 used in his declaration had been construed by this Court. (Id. at 92:18-19, 98:19-99:1).
7

Second, the demonstration was not open to the public. Rather, it was a private meeting,

8 where Mr. Tyler was invited to inspect an unfinished demonstration version of the system. (Ex. 8,
9 12/10/07 Long Dep. at 59:13-16). Such a private demonstration cannot constitute public use. See,
10 e.g., Bernhardt, 386 F.3d at 1381 (no public use where exhibitors exercised control over invitees,
11 despite lack of confidentiality agreement).
12

Third, the prototype FXFE system was demonstrated to Mr. Tyler under the supervision of

13 Chemical Bank employees. (Ex. 8, 12/10/07 Long Dep. at 55:6-56:12). Significantly, no evidence
14 exists that Mr. Tyler ever used the demonstration version of the system, a critical requirement for
15 determining public use. Id. at 57:8-9; Moleculon, 793 F.2d 1261, 1265-66; Motionless Keyboard

Fourth, the demonstration involved only an "experimental" and "beta test" version of the

21 system, emphasizing the developmental nature of the device. (Ex 9, GW-LT422218, 422220 at 146,
22 148). Indeed, Mr. Long, the system developer, admits that the version of the system shown to Mr.
23 Tyler was just a "prototype" and it was incomplete (not actively running on the network). (Ex. 8,
24 12/10/07 Long Dep. at 55:24-56:1); Motionless Keyboard, 486 F.3d at 1385 (no public use where
25 computer device was "never connected to be used in the normal course of business"); Am. Seating
26 Co. v. USSC Group, Inc., 2005 WL 1224603, *5-6 (W.D. Mich. May 23, 2005) (demonstration of
27 single prototype is not public use). And the demonstration version shown to Mr. Tyler was never
28

produced nor commercialized. (Long Dep. at 59:5-12).

Finally, defendants cannot rely on the Tyler Article to corroborate Mr. Long's testimony or

2 otherwise support public use. To the contrary, a magazine article about an incomplete, prototype,
3 beta-test, device still under development is evidence that the demonstration was not a public use. Cf.
4 Honeywell Int'l Inc. v. Universal Avionics Sys., 488 F.3d 982, 998 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (considering a
5 reporter's article describing a system as in its "development phase" as evidence contrary to "public
6 use"). Indeed, the Tyler Article itself recognizes that the system it described was an "experimental"
7 "beta test" version. (Ex 9, GW-LT422218, 422220 at 146, 148). Accordingly, defendants have not
8 shown by clear and convincing evidence that there was public use of the FXFE system.

The FXFE System and Tyler Article Are Not Enabling

Gateway does not even attempt to argue that one of ordinary skill would have been enabled
to make or use the FXFE System based on the demonstration to Mr. Tyler or the Tyler Article.
Impax Labs., Inc. v. Aventis Pharms. Inc., 468 F.3d 1366, 1381-82 (Fed. Cir. 2006) ("In order to be
anticipating, a prior art reference must be enabling so that the claimed subject matter may be made
or used by one skilled in the field."). The Tyler Article is not a technical document, instruction
manual, or any other authoritative disclosure. (Ex. 9, GW-LT 422218-422222). It does not teach or
otherwise enable one of ordinary skill how to make or use the FXFE System, and cannot serve as an
enabling reference. See Impax, 468 F.3d at 1381-82.
3.

The FXFE System Does Not Meet Each and Every Limitation of
the '356 Patent Claims

In any case, Gateway's motion should be denied because defendants have failed to present

20 clear and convincing evidence that the FXFE system practiced each and every limitation of claim 19
21 or 21 of the '356 patent. At the outset, it bears repeating that defendants have failed to present any
22 physical evidence regarding the FXFE system. They have not offered any working computer
23 system, machine, prototype, or model of the FXFE system. Indeed, defendants have failed to offer
24 any technical documentation, specifications, source code, manual, or any other source of legitimate
25 and authentic description regarding the FXFE system. (Ex. 22, 12/14/07 Tognazzini Decl. ¶ 54).
26 Defendants' assertions are further called into doubt, as the Tyler Article and Mr. Long himself
27 acknowledge that the FXFE project was constantly changing, and the demonstration version was a

1 prototype still under development. (Ex. 8, 12/10/07 Long Dep. at 29:20-30:4, 34:20-36:1, 55:242 56:12, 56:19-57:20, 59:3-59:12).
3

The only evidence presented by defendants regarding the FXFE system is (1) the Tyler

4 Article—a short general-purpose magazine article that does not purport to describe the technical
5 details of the system (and in fact does not even refer to the system as "FXFE"), and (2) the
6 uncorroborated testimony of Mr. Long, a witness retained and paid by defendants, and represented
7 by counsel for defendants. With respect to the latter, as discussed above, a witness' testimony about
8 his own antedating activity is insufficient to prove prior use. Finnigan, 180 F.3d at 1366-68.
9 Corroborating evidence must unambiguously support all elements of the patent-in-suit. Id. at 1369.
10 Thus, to the extent Mr. Long's testimony about the specific features of the FXFE system is not
11 directly and unambiguously supported by the Tyler Article, Mr. Long's testimony must be rejected.
12 Even accepting Mr. Long's testimony, however, Gateway's analysis falls far short of meeting its
13 burden of presenting clear and convincing evidence that the FXFE system disclosed each and every
14 limitation of the asserted claims, either expressly or inherently. See, e.g., Glaxo Group Ltd. v.
15 Apotex, Inc., 376 F.3d 1339, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Accordingly, the FXFE system cannot

16 anticipate the '356 patent as a matter of law.
17
18

a.

FXFE Does Not Indicate a Particular Field Into Which
Information Is to Be Inserted

Claims 19 and 21 of the '356 patent requires the step of "indicating a particular one of said

19 information fields into which information is to be inserted." (Gateway Br. at 10). As an initial
20 matter, defendants admit that the Tyler Article does not disclose this limitation. (Id. at 15).
21 Defendants nevertheless contend that the FXFE system "provided a visual indication on the screen
22 of the selected field." (Id. at 10). Gateway's only basis for this naked assertion is the conclusory
23 statement of its hired witness, Mr. Long. (Id.) However, Mr. Long's conclusory statement is
24 uncorroborated by any technical documentary evidence. Moreover, Mr. Long's statement concerns a
25 system that he has neither seen nor worked with in nearly twenty years. (Ex. 8, 12/10/07 Long Dep.
26 at 83:3-11). Where these facts are credibly disputed, and where Mr. Long's statements are called
27 into question., summary judgment is not appropriate. See, e.g., TypeRight Keyboard, 374 F.3d at

1 1158. Nor would it have been obvious to add such an indicator. As recognized by Mr. Tognazzini,
2 it appeared from the Tyler Article that there was "no need for any highlighting of any field," because
3 the Tyler Article "does not suggest that the system controlled movement between active fields." (Ex.
4 10, 10/12/07 Tognazzini Rep. ¶ 53; Ex. 22, 12/14/07 Tognazzini Decl. ¶ 19).

Defendants Fail to Present Evidence that the FXFE
System Used Any Predefined Tools Associated with Any
Information Fields

Gateway also fails to present any physical, technical, or credible documentary evidence that

8 the FXFE system used any "predefined tools" or "group of predefined tools" that are "associated
9 with" information fields as required by claims 19 and 21. As this Court recognized when it denied
10 defendants' previous motion for summary judgment of invalidity on the '356 patent, these limitations
11 are critical components of the '356 patent. This Court's claim construction requires that such
12 "predefined tool" is "associated with" an information entry field, and that the tool be "specified by
13 the system" for filling in the information called for by that field. (Ex. 3, '356 Patent Am. Claim
14 Const. Order). In rejecting defendants' previous summary judgment motion on this point, this Court
15 recognized that where, as in the case of the FXFE system, (1) an application "does not predefine the
16 tool," (2) an application "does not associate the tool with a particular field, or (3) where a tool "falls
17 outside of the form entry system," — such a system may not meet this claim limitation, or at a
18 minimum, supports the existence of a disputed fact for trial. (Ex. 11, 5/15/07 Order on Summ. J. of
19 Invalidity of '356 Patent at 5).
20

Here, defendants have presented no physical, technical, or credible documentary evidence

21 regarding whether the FXFE on-screen keyboard is predefined by any form-entry system, or whether
22 it is a separate operating system tool. (Ex. 10, 10/12/07 Tognazzini Rep. ¶ 56) ("The Tyler Article
23 certainly does not disclose a system that uses any predefined tool associated with an information
24 field that is specified by the system as an appropriate tool for filling in the information called for by
25 such information field."). And Mr. Long's testimony on this point suggests that the FXFE on-screen
26 keyboard was an operating system-level tool that was not predefined by the form entry system for
27 specific information fields:

Absolutely, yes.

(Ex. 8, 12/10/07 Long Dep. at 82:17-20; Ex. 22, 12/14/07 Tognazzini Decl. ¶ 58). At best, Mr.
Long's testimony is ambiguous on this point. And in any case, as discussed above, Mr. Long's
uncorroborated testimony is insufficient for purposes of summary judgment. See, e.g., TypeRight,
374 F.3d at 1158. Nor would it have been obvious to add such predefined tools because there was
no "problem with the system disclosed in Tyler to be solved by adding such predefined tools." (Ex.
10, 10/12/07 Tognazzini Rep. ¶ 57; Ex. 22, 12/14/07 Tognazzini Decl. ¶¶ 22-25).
Likewise, defendants have presented no physical, technical, or credible documentary
evidence regarding whether the FXFE system used any tool that was "associated with" any
information fields of a form-entry system, or "specified by the system as an appropriate tool for
filling in the information called for by that field," as required by claims 19 and 21, as construed by
the Court. (Ex. 10, 10/12/07 Tognazzini Rep. ¶¶ 56-58). The "list of brokers" and the "QWERTY
layout" pointed to by Gateway are at best ambiguous. (Gateway Br. at 10). The Tyler Article does
not disclose whether the "list of brokers" or the "QWERTY layout" of the purported FXFE system
are predefined tools that are "associated with" any form-entry information field, or "specified by the
system as an appropriate tool for filling in the information called for by that field," as required by
claims 19 and 21. Id. Further, the Tyler Article does not disclose whether the FXFE system is in
fact a form-entry system, or in any way calls upon or associates the "list of brokers" or the
"QWERTY layout" with any information field. Id. And it does not disclose whether the "list of
brokers" is a "menu of alternatives" tool as required by claims 19 and 21. Id. Again, Mr. Long fails
to offer more than conclusory statements on these points, or is at best ambiguous, and his testimony
is insufficient to establish, clearly and convincingly, summary judgment of invalidity.
Nor would it have been obvious to add such predefined tools because there was no "problem
with the system disclosed in Tyler to be solved by adding such composition or menu of alternatives
tools that are associated with specific information fields." (Ex.10, 10/12/07 Tognazzini Rep. ¶ 59;
Ex. 22, 12/14/07 Tognazzini Decl. ¶¶ 24-25).

Defendants Fail to Present Evidence that the FXFE
System Has a Graphical Composition Tool

The invention of the '356 patent used graphical displays, menus, and tools—such as the

3 graphical window displays used in Microsoft Windows operating systems and applications today.
4 Accordingly, the Court's claim construction requires that a "tool adapted to allow said user to
5 compose said information" means "a graphical keyboard tool or a graphical number keypad tool."
6 (Ex. 3, '356 Patent Am. Claim Const. Order) (emphasis added). However, defendants have failed to
7 produce clear and convincing evidence that the on-screen keypad of the FXFE system is a graphical
8 keyboard tool. Rather, the evidence suggests that the characters and lines drawn on the FXFE screen
9 are text-based or character-driven—not graphical or bitmapped—representations:

Defendants Fail to Present Evidence that the FXFE
System Used Any Tool that Is Concurrently Displayed as
by a Window Overlaying the Form

In describing the operation of the FXFE system, defendants concede that none of the tools,

22 including the on-screen keyboard shown in the Tyler Article, are "concurrently displayed" as by a
23 "window overlaying the form," as required by claims 19 and 21 and this Court's claim construction.
24 (Gateway Br. at 10-11). Defendants concede that, to bring up a tool, the user hits a "cell" on the
25 right side of the screen, and then the tools appears on the left side. (Id. at 10, 16) . The Tyler Article
26 does not disclose any "overlaying" windows, but rather depicts an earlier side-by-side system of
27 tiling display. (Ex. 10, 10/12/07 Tognazzini Rep. ¶¶ 54-55). Indeed, Mr. Long admits that the

1 FXFE system did not use overlaying windows, but rather used an older system of "tiling" displays.
2 (Ex. 8, 12/10/07 Long Dep. at 80:15-81:1; Ex. 22, 12/14/07 Tognazzini Decl. ¶ 57).
Instead, defendants argue that the Court changed its claim construction in a footnote of its

3

4 Order denying defendants' motion for summary judgment of invalidity. (Gateway Br. at 11). Not
5 true. Earlier this year the Court again re-affirmed its longstanding construction of "concurrently
6 displaying" as meaning "displaying at the same time, as by a window overlaying the form." (Ex. 4,
7 4/17/07 Order on Supplemental Claim Construction) ("the Court hereby retains the construction of
8 'concurrently displaying' as it is set forth in the Court's Order on March 1, 2004"). The Court was
9 crystal clear at the Markman hearing that this means having an overlay window: "Concurrently
10 displaying means displaying the overlay on a display of the form. Concurrently displaying means
11 displaying the overlay on a display of the form." (Ex. 12, 9/23/03 Markman Hr'g Tr. at 45:11-14)
12 (emphasis added).

This Court's construction and understanding that "concurrently displaying"

13 means "displaying at the same time, as by a window overlaying the form" is supported by the '356
14 patent which discloses overlaying windowing technology—not the older tiling-based display
15 technology used in the FXFE system: "the tool … is displayed as an overlay (window)." (Ex. 1,
16 '356 Patent abstract, 1:35, 3:51); (Ex. 13, 5/12/06 Tognazzini Rep. ¶ 141) (recognizing that the
17 "tiling" method of displaying objects is an older "side-by-side" system different from overlaid
18 windows); (Ex. 8, 12/10/07 Long Dep. at 80:15-81:1) (stating that the FXFE system did not use
5
19 windows, but rather used "tiling" object displays).

Finally, even if the Court intended to change its longstanding claim construction on this point

20

21 to allow "concurrently displaying" to encompass tiling-based displays, there certainly exists a triable
22 fact as to whether the FXFE system used any tool that was "concurrently display[ed]." As discussed,
23
24
25
26
27

The Court's footnote from its May 15, 2007 summary judgment order is entirely consistent with,
and does not change, its construction requiring overlaying windows technology. It is certainly
possible to use overlaying windowing technology, yet place windows in a "side-by-side" manner as
recognized in the Court's footnote. What the Court's construction does not encompass, however, is
older "tiling" display technology that does not allow for displaying overlaid windows at all. (Ex. 12,
9/23/03 Markman Hr'g Tr. at 45:11-14) ("Concurrently displaying means displaying the overlay on a
display of the form.").

1 the Tyler Article cannot unambiguously support this limitation and, therefore, Mr. Long's biased

Defendants Fail to Present Evidence That The FXFE
System Tools Insert Information into a Form Entry Field

Defendants again rely on the Tyler Article and Mr. Long's conclusory statements to support

8 the assertion that the FXFE system tools would insert information into an information field.
9
(Gateway Br. at 12). But, the Tyler Article does not include any description to support this
10 functionality. (Ex. 9, GW-LT 422218-422222). All the Tyler Article discloses is that "information
11 is entered into the system," but there is no disclosure of how the information is entered, or whether
12 information is actually transmitted into a form entry information field. Defendants present no
13 evidence to support that the FXFE system actually used "information fields" or a form-entry system
14 within the meaning of the '356 patent. Indeed, Mr. Long admits that the FXFE system did not use a
15 relational database. (Ex. 8, 12/10/07 Long Dep. at 25:12-24). Nor did the database "fields" of the
16 FXFE system line-up with the "labels" displayed on the FXFE screen. Id. at 52:7-11. Accordingly,
17 there is no evidence that the FXFE system was a form entry system having information fields as
18 required by the '356 patent claims, or how information is entered, or whether information is actually
19 transmitted into a form entry field. Again, defendants have presented no physical or technical
20 evidence on these points, but rely solely on Mr. Long's uncorroborated statements.
21

Mr. Long's conclusory statements add nothing on this point—especially as Mr. Long admits

22 that his declaration was not written by him, but by defendants' attorneys, and he had no
23 understanding that many of the terms used in his affidavit had been construed by this Court. (Ex. 8,
24 12/10/07 Long Dep. at 92:18-19, 98:19-99:1). And as discussed above, Mr. Long is not a computer
25 code programmer, and he was not involved with programming any of the code involved in the FXFE
26 system. (Id. at 17:8-10). Moreover, the Tyler Article says not a word about whether the FXFE
27 system has any such functionality, namely a tool that "insert[s] in said one field information that is

The FXFE System Does Not Render Obvious the '356 Patent Claims

FXFE is Not Prior Art Under Section 103

As discussed above in Section C.1, the FXFE system is not prior art under section 102—as a
8
matter of law, there was no public use of the FXFE system in the United States. Accordingly, the
9
FXFE system cannot serve as a prior art obviousness reference under section 103. See, e.g., In re
10
Wertheim, 646 F.2d 527, 532 (CCPA 1981) (prior art for purposes of 35 U.S.C. § 103 is generally

Gateway Fails to Offer Any Physical, Technical, or Credible
Documentary Evidence Regarding the FXFE System

15

Defendants are asking this Court to invalidate a valid United States patent based on a system

16 that has never been produced or inspected by anyone in this case. Defendants have produced no
17 technical, physical, or credible documentary evidence. The only basis of defendants' motion is a
18 general-purpose magazine article, and the conclusory, biased, and uncorroborated testimony of
19 defendants' paid witness.

Summary judgment of obviousness on such a basis is entirely

20 inappropriate. See, e.g., Woodland Trust, 148 F.3d at 1369.
21

The FXFE system was developed entirely in the United Kingdom. The only U.S. activity of

22 the FXFE system was the private demonstration of a "beta test," prototype, and demonstration
23 version of the FXFE system—a version which was never produced or commercialized because its
24 developers were unable to get it to work fast enough or in a cost-effective manner. (Ex. 8, 12/10/07
25 Long Dep. at 35:19-36:1) ("The system ran quite slow with the touch screen capabilities. That is
26 true."). Accordingly, the FXFE system cannot render the '356 patent obvious.

Summary Judgment of Obviousness Is Inappropriate Where
There Are Lingering Factual Issues

2

Before invalidating a patent based on obviousness, a district court must conduct a Graham

3 analysis and make particularized findings, including examining the very factual-based considerations
4 of obviousness pursuant to Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1 (1966). Accordingly, the fact5 intensive obviousness arguments are typically not appropriate for summary judgment. See, e.g.,
6 Philips Elecs. N. Am. Corp. v. Contec Corp., 177 Fed. Appx. 981, 985 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (recognizing
7 that "[s]ummary judgment on obviousness was also inappropriate" where defendants failed to
8 conduct a Graham factor obviousness analysis, and there remained issues of fact) (emphasis added).

obvious to add the missing elements to the FXFE system. The purported FXFE system was very
different from the inventions of the '356 patent, and would not have rendered the '356 patent obvious
based on any combination. (Ex. 10, 10/12/07 Tognazzini Rep. ¶¶ 49-64).
Here, defendants have introduced nothing more than conclusory statements regarding a
Graham obviousness analysis, and have provided no particularized discussion regarding (1) the
scope and content of the prior art, (2) the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art,
(3) the level of ordinary skill in the art, and (4) secondary considerations including commercial
success, long felt but unresolved needs, and failures of others to make the invention. Graham, 383
U.S. at 17-18. And after analyzing the FXFE system as purportedly described by the Tyler Article,
Lucent's expert opines that it does not render claims 19 or 21 obvious. (Ex. 10, 10/12/07 Tognazzini
Rep. ¶¶ 49-65; Ex. 22, 12/14/07 Tognazzini Decl. ¶¶ 15-31, 51-62).
Evidence of secondary considerations must also be considered prior to reaching a conclusion.
See Demaco Corp. v. F. Von Langsdorff Licensing Ltd., 851 F.2d 1387, 1390-91 (Fed. Cir. 1988)
(reversing district court's holding of nonobviousness). "Indeed, evidence of secondary considerations
may often be the most probative and cogent evidence in the record." Id. Indeed, Lucent's expert
reports examined various secondary, objective indicia of non-obviousness regarding the '356 patent,
and put forth objective indicia, based on first-hand knowledge, that the '356 patent is not obvious.

Skepticism of Others: "Inventions like the '356 patent with it's pop-up calendar
were unthinkable, let alone obvious because of the lag that would have occurred
while the data was painstakingly transferred from the hard disk to memory and
massaged into a useful form before finally being presented. In that time, a user
could easily glance at a paper desk calendar and then manually insert the
information." (Ex. 13, 5/12/06 Tognazzini Rep. ¶ 196).

•

Long-felt Need: "[T]hose of us working in the art were interested only in those
improvements that could be implemented successfully in the short term. Developers
were, overwhelmingly, interested in using those tools that we at Apple were
supplying, both because it made their development cycles shorter and because they
faced their own memory and performance limitations." (Id. ¶ 197)

•

Failure of Others, etc.: "Having failed numerous times in the past and knowing the
shortcomings of the technology ... (Id. ¶ 197). We all knew there was a problem—
people were clicking the mouse too often and 'traveling' too far to assemble the
information needed—but we didn't know what to do about it within the tight
confines of the hardware with which we had to work. Those in the art were trying
but failing to make the user experience more efficient. (Id. ¶ 199). The '356
inventors took a clever approach to solve this problem an[d] overcome all failures
of others . . ." (Id. ¶ 200).

Defendants Engage In Impermissible Hindsight

Because many inventions may seem obvious in hindsight, an accused infringer may not "pick
and choose among the individual elements of assorted prior art references to recreate the claimed
invention" and thereby invalidate a patent claim. Symbol Techs., Inc. v. Opticon, Inc., 935 F.2d
1569, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (internal quotations omitted). Moreover, "the burden falls on the patent
challenger to show by clear and convincing evidence that a person of ordinary skill in the art would
have had reason to attempt to make the composition or device, or carry out the claimed process, and
would have had a reasonable expectation of success in doing so." PharmaStem, 491 F.3d at 1360
(citing KSR, 127 S. Ct. at 1740). For that reason, the Supreme Court's KSR decision acknowledged
that "it can be important to identify a reason that would have prompted a person of ordinary skill in
the relevant field to combine elements in the way the claimed new invention does." KSR, 127 S. Ct.
at 1741. Defendants simply have not, and cannot demonstrate, that there was any reason to add the
missing elements to the FXFE system (discussed above). Accordingly, defendants have not shown,
clearly and convincingly, that claims 19 and 21 are obvious in light of the FXFE System.6

The Tyler Article Does Not Otherwise Invalidate the '356 Patent Claims

As discussed above, defendants rely on the Tyler Article merely to describe the FXFE

16 system. Accordingly, for the same reasons discussed above with respect to the FXFE system, the
17 Tyler Article does not invalidate claims 19 and 21 of the '356 patent.

ARGUMENT: MICROSOFT'S MOTION REGARDING "YOUR MONEY

20

Microsoft's motion is based on a piece of financial software entitled "Your Money Manager"

Microsoft's argument, however,

22 mischaracterizes the nature and operation of the YMM software, and completely disregards a critical

Claim 21 depends from claim 19, and is not obvious for the same reasons discussed above.
Further, claim 21 requires the use of a "bit-mapped-graphics field" which is a "field into which a
25 user is to enter information by writing on a touch sensitive screen using a stylus." (Ex. 3, '356 Patent
Am. Claim Const. Order). FXFE does not disclose this, and there would have been no reason to add
26
this to the FXFE system. (Ex. 10, 10/12/07 Tognazzini Rep. ¶¶ 62-65; Ex. 22, 12/14/07 Tognazzini

The YMM Software and the MS DOS Operating System

YMM was a personal finance program based on large-scale professional finance programs.
Defendants' motion relies on an IBM PC version of YMM that was designed to work under the MS
DOS operating system. (Ex. 10, 10/12/07 Tognazzini Rep. ¶ 39). The MS DOS operating system of
the mid-1980s was very different from the common graphical user interfaces of today—such as
Windows. At the time of the invention, applications running under MS DOS were generally textbased, and assumed an operating environment with no pointing device or touch entry. (Id.) Such a
system would have assumed an MS DOS operating system with no pointing device or touch entry,
and would have assumed that any menus or accessories may only be invoked with keyboard function
keys dedicated to each menu or accessory. Id. IBM PC computer users of the time may recall the
standard MS DOS screen with the "C:\" prompt:

The Invention of the '356 Patent Was Based on Graphical User
Interface—Not Text Based—and Requires "Pointing" to "Display Keys"

As discussed above, the invention of the '356 patent used graphical displays and menus—

22 like the graphical window displays used in Microsoft Windows operating systems and applications
23 today. Another important part of the invention of the '356 patent was that a user could (1) "point" to
24 fields to call up associated predefined tools, and (2) "point" to "display keys" on the tools that cause
25 the selection to be entered into the appropriate field. (Infra Section II.A; Ex. 1, '356 Patent cols. 326 7). Accordingly, as discussed above, the Court's claim construction requires that a "tool adapted to
27 allow said user to compose said information" means "a graphical keyboard tool or a graphical

The YMM Software Does Not Render Obvious the '356 Patent Claims

As discussed above, claims 19 and 21 of the '356 patent require a "graphical" based system
which allows the user to select and compose information by "pointing," such as with a mouse or
touch-screen. (Ex. 3, '356 Patent Am. Claim Const. Order). Defendants admit that the YMM
software did not use a mouse or touchscreen to allow users to "point" to selections on the screen.
(Microsoft Br. at 9-10). It could not, because YMM was designed under the MS DOS operating
system with a text-based interface. (Ex. 10, 10/12/07 Tognazzini Rep. ¶¶ 39-44). The MS DOS
text-based interface of the YMM software can be seen clearly below from defendants' screen-shots:

Thus, defendants are wrong in suggesting that the on-screen calculator in YMM is a "composition
tool" within the meaning of claims 19 and 21. It cannot be, because it (1) does not use "display
keys", (2) does not permit a user to compose information by "pointing" to "display keys," and (3) is
text-based, not "graphical" as required by the Court's claim construction.

(Ex. 10, 10/12/07

Tognazzini Rep. ¶ 40; Ex. 22, 12/14/07 Tognazzini Decl. ¶¶ 6-7).
1.

YMM Does Not Have "Display Keys" or "Graphical" Tools

Claims 19 and 21 require that there be "a graphical keyboard tool or a graphical number
keypad tool, which allows the user to compose information by pointing to the display keys of that
tool." (Ex. 3, '356 Patent Am. Claim Const. Order) (emphasis added). However, YMM uses neither
"display keys" nor "graphical tools." Lucent's expert makes this point clear:

The on-screen calculator of YMM is not a tool within the meaning of the Court's
construction; it does not permit a user to compose information by pointing to display
keys. Rather, the on-screen calculator . . . is merely a visual guide to the user of a
reconfiguration of the physical keyboard. For example, the on-screen calculator
visually indicates numbers that are available . . . via the physical keyboard using
certain function keys. This visual representation is presented only as an aid for the
user in using the physical keyboard. The on-screen calculator does not have 'display
keys,' nor anything by which a user could 'point' to 'display keys.'

5
(Ex. 10, 10/12/07 Tognazzini Rep. ¶ 40) (emphasis added). As shown above, the YMM on-screen
6
calculator has no "display keys." Instead, the user must push keys on the physical keyboard, such as
7
the "F1" function key to "CLR" or clear the calculator entry. Id.
8
Further, the on-screen calculator is not a "graphical number keypad tool" as required by the
9
Court's claim construction. (Ex. 3, '356 Patent Am. Claim Const. Order) (emphasis added). Rather,
10
11

as Mr. Tognazzini makes clear, the YMM calculator is a character-generated or "text-driven"
display, drawn by text characters, not a graphical tool:

Q:

[T]he on-screen calculator looks like sort of a graphical representation of what
a physical calculator looks like. Do you agree with that?

A:

I would disagree that it's a graphical representation. This is a text-driven
display. It's a text representation.

16 (Ex. 14, 11/20/07 Tognazzini Dep. at 105:18-106:2) (emphasis added). Indeed, defendants' expert
17 Mr. Buscaino agrees that YMM does not operate in a "bit-mapped graphics" mode, but rather in a
18 character-generated or "text-based" mode where "information on the screen is represented by
19 characters" not bit-mapped graphics. (Ex. 15, 11/7/07 Buscaino Dep. at 108:3-18).

Pushing Physical Keys on a Physical Keyboard is Not "Pointing
to the Display Keys" of a "Graphical" Tool

Claims 19 and 21 require that a user "compose information by pointing to the display keys of

22 that tool." (Ex. 3, '356 Patent Am. Claim Const. Order) (emphasis added). In an attempt to put the
23 square pegged-YMM into the round-hole of the '356 claims, defendants contend that pushing
24 physical keys on a physical keyboard is the same as "pointing to the display keys" of a "graphical
25 number keypad tool." The invention of the '356 patent was directed at the use of "more desirable"
26 on-screen graphical tools that avoided "using the computer keyboard." (Ex. 1, '356 Patent col. 1:1627 36). YMM simply does not use "graphical" tools with "display keys." (Ex. 22, 12/14/07 Tognazzini
28

Decl. ¶¶ 7-9). The absurdity of defendants' argument is further highlighted by their claim that

1 pushing a physical keyboard key is the same as "pointing" to a graphical "display key." This is
2 wrong. The YMM software admittedly does not use any well-understood "pointing" device such as
3 a mouse or touchscreen—and there is no way to "point" to a "display key."
4

I think [Mr. Buscaino's] explanation of a pointing device was, was completely 100
percent wrong . . . I had no idea that Mr. Buscaino would completely redefine
'pointing device' to mean something entirely different from the recognized standard of
what a 'pointing device' is.

(Ex. 14, 11/20/07 Tognazzini Dep. at 17:13-15; 18:1-5, 12-14).7

Because pushing keys on a

keyboard is vastly different from "pointing" to a graphical "display kay" with a mouse or other
"pointing device," the YMM software does not disclose any composition tool within the meaning of
the patent claims. Thus, at a minimum, the questions of (1) whether the text-based on-screen
calculator could be considered a "graphical" tool, (2) whether it has "display keys," and (3) whether
pressing a key on a keyboard constitutes "pointing" to a graphical "display key" raise issues of fact.

15

3.

It Would Not Have Been Obvious to Add "Graphical" Tools
With "Display Keys" to the YMM Program

16

There was simply no reason to modify YMM to use "graphical" tools used by "pointing to

17 the display keys" of such tools. (Ex. 10, 10/12/07 Tognazzini Rep. ¶¶ 41-42). YMM was an entirely
18 keyboard-driven application, designed to work on the keyboard-based MS DOS operating system,
19 and designed to work using a text-based display. Id. The user manual for the YMM system makes
20 clear that the system was designed to be operated only with a keyboard. (Ex. 16, MSLT_123396321 65). Indeed, defendants' own expert admits that the YMM software did not work with a mouse, and
22 he was unable to make it work with a mouse:
Q:

23

[W]ere you able to use the mouse to point to items while running the YMM
program?

7

Defendants' own witness for the FXFE system admits that "pointing" is vastly different than using
keys on a keyboard. (Ex. 8, 12/10/07 Long Dep. at 95:19-96:16) (recognizing that the "point" and
27 "touch" version of the FXFE system was entirely different than the keyboard driven version).

2 (Ex. 15, 11/7/07 Buscaino Dep. at 106:18-23) (emphasis added). Mr. Buscaino's observations were
3 consistent with the opinions of Lucent's expert Mr. Tognazzini—that it would not have been
4 obvious, at the time of the invention, to implement a mouse with the YMM software. (Ex. 10,
5 10/12/07 Tognazzini Rep. ¶¶ 41-42; Ex. 22, 12/14/07 Tognazzini Decl. ¶¶ 8-11).
6

Nor would it have been obvious to implement "display keys," "graphical" tools, or a mouse

7 with the MS DOS based YMM software. Indeed, at the time, the use of MS DOS based software
8 taught away from using a mouse or pointing device. (Ex. 10, 10/12/07 Tognazzini Rep. ¶ 41). MS
9 DOS based programs at the time, such as YMM, were generally presumed to be text-driven, and it
10 was generally presumed that such software would not be used with a mouse or other pointing device.
11 Id. YMM was optimized for the keyboard, and was never designed to work with a mouse. Id. In
12 order to use a mouse with the YMM software, the software would have needed to be modified
13 significantly, a task characterized as very difficult. Id.
14

Indeed, Lucent's expert Mr. Tognazzini has direct experience with modifying old non-mouse

15 software to be used with a mouse, and characterizes any such task as having "extreme difficulties."
16 (Ex. 14, 11/20/07 Tognazzini Dep. at 27:21). In this sense, the YMM software teaches away from
17 the use of a composition tool such as a "graphical number keypad tool" having "display keys" and
18 the concept of composing information by "pointing" to those "display keys."
19

Even if a mouse were somehow added to the YMM software, the YMM on-screen calculator

20 would still fail to possess "display keys" with which a user can interact or point to. (Ex. 10,
21 10/12/07 Tognazzini Rep. ¶ 42; Ex. 22, 12/14/07 Tognazzini Decl. ¶ 9). The YMM software would
22 need to be wholly redesigned to permit user interaction with the on-screen calculator using a mouse.
23 Id. Contrary to defendants' suggestion, it is not just a simple matter of adding a mouse to YMM and
24 arrive at the claimed invention. Rather, to somehow convert YMM into a system that meets all the
25 elements of claims 19 or 21 would require "a complete shift in user-interface paradigm from a
26 physical keyboard driven device to an on-screen driven device." Id.

Microsoft Fails to Make Particularized Showing of Obviousness

As discussed above with respect to each missing claim element, it would not have been
obvious to add the missing elements to the YMM software. The tools of YMM were very different
from the inventions of the '356 patent, and YMM would not have rendered the '356 patent obvious
based on any combination. (Ex. 10, 10/12/07 Tognazzini Rep. ¶¶ 39-48). As with the previous
reference, defendants have introduced nothing more than conclusory statements regarding a Graham
obviousness analysis.

Graham, 383 U.S. at 17.

Lucent's expert looked at these issues, and

demonstrates that relevant record evidence exists to rebut any charge of obviousness. (Ex. 10,
10/12/07 Tognazzini Rep. ¶¶ 39-48; Ex. 22, 12/14/07 Tognazzini Decl. ¶¶ 7-14).
For example, as discussed above in Section VI.D.3, Lucent's expert considered several
secondary, objective considerations of non-obviousness regarding the '356 patent. See Demaco, 851
F.2d at 1391 ("evidence of secondary considerations may often be the most probative and cogent
evidence in the record"). Mr. Tognazzini recognized that there was a long-felt need to solve some of
the problems identified in the '356 patent; he noted that there was skepticism of others in arriving at
a solution based on computer performance limitations at the time; and he recognized that others had
failed to develop the invention of the '356 patent. (Ex. 13, 5/12/06 Tognazzini Rep. ¶¶ 47-49; Ex.
10, 10/12/07 Tognazzini Rep. ¶¶ 109-114; Ex. 22, 12/14/07 Tognazzini Decl. ¶¶ 46-50).
Defendants likewise neglect to acknowledge the Supreme Court's recognition that "it can be
important to identify a reason that would have prompted a person of ordinary skill in the relevant
field to combine elements in the way the claimed new invention does." KSR, 127 S.Ct. at 1741. Mr.
Tognazzini explains that there would have been no reason to modify the YMM software such that it
would satisfy the missing claim limitations:

22
23
24
25
26
27

YMM was designed for MS DOS, and was not presumed to work with—or need—
such pointing devices . . . Thus, at the time, there was simply no reason to combine
the mouse-based interface used in such newer systems with the keyboard-based
interface used in the older and soon to be obsolete MS DOS system. Further, one of
ordinary skill in the art would not have considered adding a mouse-based interface to
YMM because YMM was optimized for the keyboard-driven MS DOS system. Such
a combination would likely have slowed down the YMM user. In addition, as
discussed above, adding a mouse to YMM would not even work, and require not only
reconfiguring the system but also reconfiguring the on-screen calculator . . . In other

on the Home Accountant reference. (Ex. 17, 1/26/07 Br. Re Invalidity of the '356 Patent). After
7
significant briefing and argument regarding this reference, this Court denied defendants' motion.
8
(Ex. 11, 5/15/07 Order re Invalidity of the '356 Patent). Defendants now seek to rehash their losing
9
arguments by suggesting that the Home Accountant software renders claims 19 and 21 of the '356
10
patent claims obvious when viewed in light of the Tyler Article. However, as with the other
11
references discussed above, there is ample evidence to rebut Dell's rehashed claims of obviousness
12
and—at a minimum—demonstrate genuine disputes for trial.9
13
A.
The Home Accountant Program Does Not Disclose Several Limitations
14
This Court has already recognized that the Home Accountant program does not disclose
15 several required claim limitations. (Ex. 11, 5/15/07 Order re Invalidity of the '356 Patent).
16

18

Home Accountant Has No Predefined Composition Tool That is
Associated With Information Fields as Specified by the Form
Entry System

First, the Home Accountant program does not contain any "predefined" composition tool that

19 is "associated with" the information fields and "specified by" the form-entry system. Defendants
20 previously argued that the Macintosh "Key Caps" desk accessory satisfied this limitation. However,
21 the "Key Caps" utility was an unrelated Macintosh operating system accessory, as seen below. (Ex.
22
8

Claim 21 depends from claim 19, and is not obvious for the same reasons discussed above.
Further, claim 21 requires the use of a "bit-mapped-graphics field" which is a "field into which a
24 user is to enter information by writing on a touch sensitive screen using a stylus." (Ex. 3, '356 Patent
Am. Claim Const. Order). YMM does not disclose this, and there would have been no reason to add
25 this to the YMM program. (Ex. 10, 10/12/07 Tognazzini Rep. ¶¶ 45-48).
23

As set forth above, Lucent maintains that defendants are precluded from relying on the Tyler
Article
pursuant to the Court's May 15, 2007 Order on Lucent's Motion to Strike.

13, 5/12/06 Tognazzini Rep. ¶¶ 122-123). The "Key Caps" utility (like other Macintosh desk
accessories) was a small general purpose application that could be used at any time, and importantly,
was not associated with any other software applications run on the Macintosh (Ex. 13, 5/12/06
Tognazzini Rep. ¶ 125; Ex. 22, 12/14/07 Tognazzini Decl. ¶ 37).

The Home Accountant program was a completely separate software application for the
Macintosh computer that allowed users to store personal finance information and enter personal
check information. (Ex. 18, 3/31/06 Buscaino Rep. ¶ 57). Users of the Home Accountant program
would normally use a computer keyboard to manually enter information into the fields, and
manually move between data entry fields (e.g. by using the Tab or Enter key). (Ex. 18, 3/31/06
Buscaino Rep. ¶¶ 60-61). This method of entering data was much like the prior art disclosed in the
background section of the '356 patent. (Ex. 1, the '356 Patent col. 1:8-22).
This Court denied defendants' previous motion for summary judgment regarding the Home
Accountant, and determined that the cobbled-together combination of Home Accountant and Key
Caps does not meet the '356 patent claim limitations, at a minimum because the Home Accountant
application does not contain any "predefined" composition tool that is "associated with" each data
entry field and "specified by" the form-entry system.10 (Ex. 11, 5/15/07 Order re Invalidity of the
'356 Patent).
10

Lucent explained in its previous opposition brief on this reference that the "Key Caps" desk
accessory was never intended to be an "on-screen keyboard" or a virtual keyboard as suggested by
Defendants. (Ex. 21, 2/9/07 Lucent Opp. Br. to Microsoft Motion for SJ of Invalidity re '356

Home Accountant Does Not "Insert[] in Said One Field
Information That is Derived as a Result of Said User Operating
Said Displayed Tool"

Second, the Home Accountant program does not disclose "inserting in said one field
information that is derived as a result of said user operating said displayed tool." Again, defendants
previously argued that one could use the Macintosh "Key Caps" desk accessory to somehow
compose information and insert it into a Home Accountant information field. In denying defendants'
previous motion regarding Home Accountant, this Court recognized that the Home Accountant form
entry system did not insert any information into any field. (Ex. 11, 5/15/07 Order re Invalidity of the
'356 Patent at 5). Instead, only by going through a time consuming and laborious process could one
somehow "cut and paste" information from "Key Caps" into Home Accountant. (Ex. 19, 6/29/06
Buscaino Dep. (Part B) at 87:11-88:23 (recognizing the process as "a very long set of steps"); Ex.
20, 6/27/06 Tognazzini Dep. at 127:8-13) (same).
B.

It Would Not Have Been Obvious to Add the Missing Elements to the
Macintosh Home Accountant Program
1.

The Home Accountant Application was Not Designed to be Used
With, and Would Not Have Worked With, a Predefined and
Associated Composition Tool

Lucent's expert Mr. Tognazzini had significant experience with designing user interface

17 objects for the Apple computer—he worked at Apple for fourteen years, and was Apple's first
18 application software programmer. (Ex. 20, 6/27/06 Tognazzini Dep. at 12:7-23). Significantly, he
19 knows that the early on-screen keypads such as the "Key Caps" desk accessory were "never
20 intended" to be a keyboard replacement. (Id. at 126:25-127:1; Ex. 13, 5/12/06 Tognazzini Rep. ¶
21 123). Moreover, Mr. Tognazzini knows well that the desk accessories were not linked to, called into
22 existence by, or otherwise activated by separate application programs as suggested by defendants.
23

Nor would it have been obvious to modify or change the Macintosh Home Accountant

24 application to either (1) link or associate a predefined composition tool to specific information fields,
25
Patent). Rather, the "Key Caps" accessory was a simple object to show different fonts, and to allow
a user to cut and paste single non-text-symbols used with certain fonts. (Ex. 20, 6/27/06 Tognazzini
27 Dep. at 126:13-127:3; Ex. 13, 5/12/06 Tognazzini Rep. ¶¶ 124-125).

1 or (2) modify the Home Accountant form entry system such that it would have inserted information
2 into an associated information field. (Ex. 13, 5/12/06 Tognazzini Rep. ¶¶ 121-125). Indeed, during
3 the relevant time, Macintosh memory and programming limitations taught away from the type of
4 modifications and combinations now suggested by defendants. (Ex. 13, 5/12/06 Tognazzini Rep.
5 ¶¶ 197-200; Ex. 22, 12/14/07 Tognazzini Decl. ¶¶ 32-44).

With respect to Apple Macintosh

6 applications such as the Home Accountant, Mr. Tognazzini was well aware that the type of
7 modification now suggested by Dell would have been unworkable:
8
9
10
11
12
13
14

The Macintosh's introduction in 1984 actually made things worse. The Mac's internal
memory was so small that nothing more than essentials could reside in memory. Any
time a special routine was needed for the program, the user would have to remove the
disk holding the user's documents, replace it with the program disk, and swap back
the document disk.
Providing tools as per the '356 patent would have almost certainly resulted in the
original Macintosh computers slowing to a crawl. The memory got marginally
larger by 1985, but there was still no hard disk, and the extra memory was soon being
used by the Switcher, enabling people to hold more than one application in memory
at a time.

15 (Ex. 13, 5/12/06 Tognazzini Rep. ¶¶ 197-200; Ex. 22, 12/14/07 Tognazzini Decl. ¶¶ 35, 47)
16 (emphasis added). In other words, the combination that Dell now suggests in hindsight—modifying
17 the Home Accountant application for the Macintosh to work with the claimed tools of the '356
18 patent—simply was not workable. Id.

Dell Fails to Make Particularized Showing of Obviousness

As discussed above, it would not have been obvious to change or modify the Home
Accountant application to meet the missing '356 patent claim limitations. Home Accountant was a
simple personal finance program that was never intended to be used with the linked composition
tools of the '356 patent invention. Home Accountant would not have rendered the '356 patent
obvious in light of the Tyler Article. (Ex. 22, 12/14/07 Tognazzini Decl. ¶¶ 32-44). As with the
previous references, defendants have introduced nothing more than conclusory statements regarding
a Graham obviousness analysis, including any particularized discussion regarding (1) the scope and
content of the prior art, (2) the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art, (3) the
level of ordinary skill in the art, and (4) secondary considerations including commercial success,

1 long felt but unresolved needs, and failures of others to make the invention. Graham, 383 U.S. at
2 17. Lucent's expert looked at these issues, and demonstrates that relevant record evidence exists to
3 rebut any charge of obviousness. (Ex. 22, 12/14/07 Tognazzini Decl. ¶¶ 32-44).
For example, as discussed above in Section VI.D.3, Lucent's expert considered several

4

5 secondary, objective considerations of non-obviousness regarding the '356 patent. See Demaco, 851
6 F.2d at 1391 ("evidence of secondary considerations may often be the most probative and cogent
7 evidence in the record"). Mr. Tognazzini recognized that there was a long-felt need to solve some of
8 the problems identified in the '356 patent; he noted that there was skepticism of others in arriving at
9 a solution based on computer performance limitations at the time; and he recognized that others had
10 failed to develop the invention of the '356 patent. (Ex. 13, 5/12/06 Tognazzini Rep. ¶¶ 194-200; Ex.
11 10, 10/12/07 Tognazzini Rep. ¶¶ 109-114; Ex. 22, 12/14/07 Tognazzini Decl. ¶¶ 45-50).
Defendants likewise neglect to acknowledge the Supreme Court's recognition that "it can be

12

13 important to identify a reason that would have prompted a person of ordinary skill in the relevant
14 field to combine elements in the way the claimed new invention does." KSR, 127 S. Ct. at 1741.
15 Indeed, at the relevant time, there would have been no reason to modify the Home Accountant
16 program such that it would satisfy the missing claim limitations—and in fact the Macintosh system
17 limitations would have taught away from such changes. (Ex. 13, 5/12/06 Tognazzini Rep. ¶¶ 19718 200; Ex. 22, 12/14/07 Tognazzini Decl. ¶ 43). Accordingly, this Court should deny Dell's motion for
19 summary judgment of obviousness of claims 19 and 21 based on the Home Accountant program and
20 the Tyler Article.
21 IX.

CONCLUSION

22

For the foregoing reasons, Lucent respectfully requests that the Court deny defendants'

23 motions for summary judgment of invalidity regarding the '356 patent.
