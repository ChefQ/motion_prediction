Filed 10/29/10 Page 2 of 3

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that on December 10, 2010 at 9:00 a.m. in Courtroom

2

602 of the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, located at 401 W.

3

Washington Street, Phoenix, Arizona, or as soon thereafter as counsel may be heard,

4

Defendant Maynard L. Jenkins will, and hereby does, move, pursuant to Rule 56(f) of the

5

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for a continuance of the hearing on and this Court’s

6

consideration of Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission’s Motion for Partial

7

Summary Judgment (the “SEC’s Motion”), in order to “enable affidavits to be obtained,

8

depositions to be taken, or other discovery to be undertaken.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f)(2).

9

In his Opposition to the SEC’s Motion, Mr. Jenkins requests that the Motion be

10

denied on the ground that Plaintiff has failed to establish that the undisputed facts support

11

grant of the Motion and also requests that the Court deny the Motion under Rule 56(f).

12

This Motion is made as an alternative to the Court’s denial of the SEC’s Motion and in the

13

event that the Court believes that a formal Motion is required to obtain a continuance

14

under Rule 56(f).

15

This Motion for Continuance is based upon this Notice of Motion and Motion, the

16

attached Memorandum of Points and Authorities, and the Memorandum of Points and

17

Authorities and Declaration of Gregory J. Weingart filed by Mr. Jenkins in opposition to

18

the SEC’s Motion, the pleadings and records on file in this action, and such further

19

argument as may be offered in any Reply or at the time of the hearing on this Motion.

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

1

Rule 56(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states that if a party opposing a

2
3

summary judgment motion “shows by affidavit that, for specific reasons, it cannot present

4

facts essential to justify its opposition,” the Court may: “(1) deny the motion; (2) order a

5

continuance to enable affidavits to be obtained, depositions to be taken, or other discovery

6

to be undertaken; or (3) issue any other just order.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f). Because the

7

purpose of Rule 56(f) is “to provide an additional safeguard against an improvident or

8

premature grant of summary judgment,” courts have generally applied the rule “with a

9

spirit of liberality.” See C. Wright, A. Miller & M. Kane, Federal Practice and

10

Procedure § 2740, at 402 (3d ed. 1998).
Mr. Jenkins’ memorandum filed concurrently in opposition to the SEC’s Motion

11
12

for Partial Summary Judgment and the supporting Weingart Declaration set forth in detail:

13

(1) the specific information that Mr. Jenkins expects to obtain that would potentially raise

14

genuine issues of material facts sufficient to defeat the SEC’s Motion; (2) the specific

15

individuals from whom Mr. Jenkins expects to obtain that information; and (3) the reasons

16

why additional time is necessary to obtain such information under present circumstances.
For these reasons, in the event that the Court does not deny the SEC’s Motion for

17
18

the reasons set forth in Mr. Jenkins’ Opposition, by this Motion Mr. Jenkins requests that

19

the Court continue the hearing on and its consideration of the Motion for the reasons

20

stated.
