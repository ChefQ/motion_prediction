No. 02-101C
Judge Wolski

DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE
OUT OF TIME ITS OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS’
MOTION FOR LEAVE TO ADD ADDITIONAL PLAINTIFFS
Defendant respectfully requests permission to file out of
time its opposition to plaintiffs’ motion for leave to add
additional plaintiffs.

Our opposition was due August 21, 2006.

As grounds for this motion, we state that for nearly four years,
this case was not a designated electronic case.

As a

consequence, defendant generally was in the habit of keeping
track of filings in this case by watching for documents in her
mailbox.
On July 27, 2006, this case was designated an electronic
case.

That was also Government counsel’s first day of summer

vacation; she was absent from her office from July 27, 2006,
through August 13, 2006.

Upon her return, Government counsel

reviewed the vast number of e-mails that had accumulated during
her absence but failed to notice the e-mail advising her of the
electronic filing of plaintiffs’ motion for leave to add
additional plaintiffs.

As a consequence, Government counsel was

unaware that this motion had been filed until she was so advised
by the Court.

For these reasons, we respectfully request

permission to file this opposition to plaintiffs’ motion out of
time.
As indicated above, we respectfully oppose plaintiffs’
motion to add additional plaintiffs at this time.

The timing of

the motion, coming some four and one half years after the
complaint was filed and after our original opposition to
plaintiffs’ motion for class certification was filed; more than
one year after the Court’s decision on liability; and even after
our amended opposition to plaintiffs’ motion for class
certification was filed, is clearly prejudicial to the
Government.
We have not had the opportunity to conduct any discovery
with respect to the potential new plaintiffs concerning their
suitability either as class representatives or as plaintiffs.
For example, we have not had an opportunity to ascertain whether
any of these plaintiffs were members of unions that were parties
to collective bargaining agreements and, so, may have claims that
fall outside the jurisdiction of this Court.
Moreover, we have not even had an opportunity to verify that
these potential plaintiffs are or were employees of the Veterans
Administration (VA).

Several of the potential plaintiffs are not

listed in the VA’s current computerized employment rolls; for

others the information contained in the computer does not match
that provided by plaintiffs’ counsel.
In addition, we have not had the opportunity to address the
impact of these potential new plaintiffs in our opposition to
plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.

In that opposition,

we demonstrated that this case does not meet the criteria for
class certification because, inter alia, plaintiffs have not met
their burden of demonstrating that the claims of the two named
plaintiffs are typical of potential class claims.

Had the named

plaintiffs included these additional individuals at the time we
filed our opposition, we would have addressed the question of
whether these individuals assist or detract from plaintiffs’
effort to meet the criteria for class certification.
We note that plaintiffs have provided little justification
for adding these specific individuals to the case at this time
beyond their desire to increase the total number of potential
class representatives.

Plaintiffs do not explain what specific

benefits would accrue from the addition of these particular
individuals or how they strengthen plaintiffs’ argument for class
certification.
At this time, the issue of class certification has been
fully briefed.

If the Court rules in plaintiffs’ favor, the

individuals plaintiffs seek to add can join as class members.
the Court rules in the Government’s favor, these potential

plaintiffs can file their own complaint, a step they can take at
any time, of course, without awaiting the Court’s decision.
Based upon the foregoing, we oppose plaintiffs’ motion for
leave to add additional plaintiffs.

Accordingly, we respectfully

request the Court to deny the motion at this time.
