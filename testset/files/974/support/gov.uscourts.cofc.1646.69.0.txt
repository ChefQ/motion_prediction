THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

Electronically filed on August 3, 2006

Registered Nurses or as “hybrid” employees, and regularly received premium pay pursuant to
Title 38, U.S.C. for regularly scheduled weekend and night duty that was not included in their biweekly pay when they used paid leave. Each additional Plaintiff’s full name, address, last four
digits of their social security number, place of employment, and position are identified in the list
attached as Exhibit 1. If the Court so requests, Plaintiffs can file under seal an unredacted
exhibit containing the potential Class Representatives’ full social security numbers pursuant to
General Order No. 42A, Part VII, paragraph 26.
Adding these persons to the list of named Plaintiffs as additional potential Class
Representatives is the only change being proposed in this motion. Defendant has taken Plaintiffs
to task in various briefs filed in this case that there are only two named Plaintiffs listed as
potential Class Representatives. However, the opinion of the Court with respect to liability has
drawn the attention of many professional employees and former employees of the VA who have
been paid pursuant to Title 38, and these additional persons have expressed their intent to serve
as potential Class Representatives in order to protect the interests of other class members. As
such, granting leave to add these additional plaintiffs will not cause any delay with respect to the
resolution of this matter.
Counsel for the Plaintiffs have discussed Plaintiffs’ motion to seek leave to add these
additional named Plaintiffs with counsel for the United States, who has not responded as to
whether the United States would or would not oppose this motion.
