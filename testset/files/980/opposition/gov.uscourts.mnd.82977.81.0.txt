PLAINTIFF’S MEMORANDUM OF LAW
IN RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTS’
MOTION IN LIMINE TO EXCLUDE
EXPERT TESTIMONY

v.
City of Golden Valley,
Dennis Arons,

David Kuhnly, and
Christine McCarville,

Defendants.
________________________________________________________________________
I.

INTRODUCTION

On August 17, 2007, Defendants filed a Motion in Limine and supporting
Memorandum of Law to exclude Plaintiff Al Hixon from submitting “any type of expert
testimony at trial,” including testimony by Mr. Hixon’s treating physicians.1 Defendants
couch their motion in terms of attempting to exclude “expert” testimony.

This

characterization is misplaced. Plaintiff’s treating physicians are not specially retained
experts for this litigation subject to Rule 26(a)(2)(B) requirements.

Nor were they

understood to be subject to expert disclosure provisions contained in this Court’s June 6,
2006 Pre-trial Scheduling Order.

The treating physicians are not specially retained

experts and will not testify as such. Nonetheless, Plaintiff provided full disclosure of
1

The term “treating physicians” is used throughout this memorandum to refer to both Dr.
John R. Shirriff, a medical doctor and licensed psychiatrist, and to Ginny Jacobs, a
licensed psychologist and licensed Marriage and Family counselor, who are both
employed at BHSI (Behavioral Health Services clinic) in Golden Valley, Minnesota.

CASE 0:06-cv-01548-RHK-JSM Document 81 Filed 08/23/07 Page 2 of 22

medical records and treating physician witnesses months ago. Defendants’ allegations of
“surprise” and/or prejudice are unsubstantiated and flat out overstated.
Defendants have known since early in this case that Plaintiff had suffered
psychological injuries and was being treated by these and other mental health
professionals. Indeed, Defendants demanded and received an independent psychological
evaluation nine months ago, in December 2006. This Motion is driven in large part
undoubtedly by the fact that Defendants’ hand-picked expert concurred with the
diagnosis of chronic PTSD resulting from the April 12, 2005, incident with Defendants.
Defendants next try to limit the Plaintiff’s treating physician from testifying about
causation. First, prevailing caselaw is against Defendants’ argument. Second, with
respect to cases involving PTSD, decisions do not exist in this jurisdiction supporting
Defendants’ contention. The fact that this case involves PTSD is significant on this issue.
Defendants’ fail to acknowledge that in the case of PTSD causation is an essential part of
the diagnosis and treatment. They cannot be separated. Unlike many injuries in which
the cause is either irrelevant to treatment or merely secondary to treatment, with PTSD
there can be no diagnosis without it.
In any event, Plaintiff’s treating physicians’ testimony on causation meet the
standards of Daubert.
Finally, Defendants’ arguments to exclude the expert testimony on liability of
Anthony Bouza is equally misplaced and he should be allowed to testify at the
appropriate time during trial.

ARGUMENT

TREATING PHYSICIANS – DR. JOHN SHIRRIFF AND MS. GINNY
JACOBS
1.

Neither Rule 26(a)(2)(B) Nor This Court’s June 6, 2006 Scheduling
Order Precludes Nor Limits the Testimony of Plaintiff’s Treating
Physicians.
a.

The Rule or Order does not apply to testimony of treating
physicians.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(B) requires that a written report be
disclosed for “a witness who is retained or specially employed to provide expert
testimony in the case or whose duties as an employee of the party regularly involve
giving expert testimony . . .” Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(B). The Pre-trial Scheduling Order
of this Court made no specific requirements about treating physicians, and did not
indicate or imply that treating physicians would be treated as “experts” and must be
disclosed by the stated deadline or be lost. See Vecchio v. Schaefer, No. 05-3194-CV-SFJG, 2007 WL 1813578, *3 (W.D.Mo. June 22, 2007) (court’s scheduling order
specifically discusses treating physicians).
In this case, Defendants provide no evidence, nor can they, that Dr. Shirriff or Ms.
Jacobs were retained to provide “expert” testimony in this litigation. Mr. Hixon sought
treatment from Dr. Shirriff and Ms. Jacobs on his own initiative, and at the urging of his
wife because of the extreme emotional symptoms Mr. Hixon was continuing to
experience following the incident that occurred on April 2, 2005. (See Shirriff Affidavit
(“Aff.”), ¶ 6; Jacobs Aff., ¶ 6.) In fact, the undersigned attorneys in this case did not

3

CASE 0:06-cv-01548-RHK-JSM Document 81 Filed 08/23/07 Page 4 of 22

learn that Mr. Hixon had even sought treatment from Dr. Shirriff and Ms. Jacobs until
over four months later during Mr. Hixon’s deposition on December 18, 2006. Ms. Jacobs
diagnosed Mr. Hixon with PTSD during her initial session with Mr. Hixon on August 7,
2006, and recommended treatment at that time. (See Jacobs Aff., ¶¶ 8, 9; Aff. of
Anthony Edwards (“Edwards”), Ex. 1, Deposition of Dr. John Shirriff (“Shirriff Depo.”),
Ex. 36.) Dr. Shirriff diagnosed Mr. Hixon with PTSD and depression during his initial
session with Mr. Hixon on August 22, 2006, and recommended treatment at that time.
(See Shirriff Aff., ¶¶ 10, 12; Edwards Aff., Ex. 1, pp. 13, 39; Shirriff Depo. Ex. 36.)
Clearly Dr. Shirriff’s and Ms. Jacobs’s diagnoses and treatment were made independent
of litigation, and their testimony is not a result of being retained or specially employed to
provide expert testimony in this case.

The treating physicians are fact witnesses

providing testimony as to their specific personal care and treatment of Mr. Hixon.
Rule 26(a)(2)(B) does not serve to exclude testimony of treating physicians. The
1993 Advisory Committee expressly notes that treating physicians may be deposed or
called to testify without providing a written report described in Rule 26(a)(2)(B). 1993
cmte. cmt. (“A treating physician, for example, can be deposed or called to testify at trial
without any requirement for a written report.”) The information to be included in a Rule
26(a)(2)(B), such as the amount of compensation and identification of other cases in
which they have testified, is information typically required of specially retained expert
witnesses, not physicians, an indication of the different treatment for persons subject to
Rule 26(a)(2)(B). See Wreath v. United States, 161 F.R.D. 448, 449 (D. Kan. 1995).

4

CASE 0:06-cv-01548-RHK-JSM Document 81 Filed 08/23/07 Page 5 of 22

Caselaw in the Eighth Circuit, as well as elsewhere, also supports this conclusion.
See, e.g., Mackey v. Burlington Northern Santa FE Ry. Co., No. 05-4133-SAC, 2006 WL
3512958 (D.Kan. Nov. 29, 2006) (“The expert report requirement in Fed.R.Civ.P.
26(a)(2)(B) applies only to witnesses ‘retained or specially employed to provide expert
testimony on the case;’” the requirement does not apply to treating physicians who
provide testimony regarding opinions based on their personal care and treatment of the
patient); Navrude v. United States Postal Serv., No. C01-4039-PAZ, 2003 WL 356091
(N.D. Iowa Feb. 11, 2003) (“Courts draw a distinction between ‘hired guns’ who
examine a patient or a patient’s records for purposes of litigation, and treating physicians
whose opinion testimony is based upon their personal knowledge of the treatment of the
information;” thus plaintiff’s treating physician is not subject to Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(B)
report requirement); Smith v. Nebraska Dept. of Corr. Serv., No. 8:99CV131, 2002 WL
1163735, *2 (D. Neb. June 4, 2002) (“Rule 26(a)(2) . . . excludes treating physicians
from the expert disclosure requirements. . . . As an expert who has not been retained for
purposes of litigation, a treating physician may testify to events and opinions arising
directly through her treatment of the patient”); Wreath v. United States, 161 F.R.D. 448,
449 (D. Kan. 1995) (“Clearly, treating physicians testifying only to the care and treatment
afforded to a party were intended to be excluded from the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P.
26(a)(2)(B)”); see also Kitts v. Gen. Telephone North, Inc., No. 2:04-CV-173, 2005 WL
2277438 (S.D. Ohio Sept. 19, 2005) (no Rule 26(a)(2)(B) report required for a treating
physician who offer opinion testimony based on facts learned during treatment of the
patient and familiarity with the specific nature of the patient’s condition); Rogers v.

CASE 0:06-cv-01548-RHK-JSM Document 81 Filed 08/23/07 Page 6 of 22

Detroit Edison Co., 328 F.Supp.2d 687, 689 (E.D. Mich. 2004) (a majority of courts hold
that a Rule 26(a)(2)(B) report is not required from a treating physician testifying to
matters learned in the scope of treatment); McCloughan v. City of Springfield, 208
F.R.D. 236, 241 (C.D. Ill. 2002) (“[treating] physician does not need to submit an expert
report if planned testimony was acquired, not in preparation for trial, but rather as an
actor . . . to transactions or occurrences that are a part of the subject matter of the
lawsuit”) (citations omitted); Zurba v. United States, 202 F.R.D. 590, 591 (N.D. Ill. 2001)
(“A treating physician is not considered a retained expert for purposes of Rule 26(a)(2),
and thus need not submit a report if his testimony is based on observations made during
the course of treatment, the testimony was not acquired or developed in anticipation of
litigation or for trial, and the testimony is based on personal knowledge”) (citations
omitted); Riddick v. Washington Hosp. Ctr., 183 F.R.D. 327, 330 (D.D.C. 1998) (“As a
treating physician, Dr. Mines may describe what she has seen, describe and explain her
diagnosis and the treatment she prescribed, and offer here opinions and expert inferences
therefrom – all without running afoul of the constraints of Rules 26 and 37 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure”).
The cases Defendants cite in support of their position that a Rule 26(a)(2)(B)
report is required before Plaintiff’s treating physicians may testify at all in this case are
not on point. The cases Defendants cite stand for the proposition that a treating physician
may be subject to the Rule 26(a)(2)(B) requirement of a written report if the treating
physician is called to testify as an expert with an opinion that is not based on his/her
treatment and care of the patient. See McCloughan, 208 F.R.D. at 242 (finding treating

CASE 0:06-cv-01548-RHK-JSM Document 81 Filed 08/23/07 Page 7 of 22

physicians may offer opinion testimony on causation, diagnosis, and prognosis without
providing a Rule 26(a)(2)(B) report).

As McClouhan noted, “the Seventh Circuit’s

footnote in O’Conner merely stands for the proposition that if a treating physician is
going to give expert testimony, he must satisfy Rule 702’s requirements. . . . The
Seventh Circuit did not make any reference therein to Rule 26 or its requirements.” Id.
(emphasis added). This is simply not the case here.
Plaintiff has been unable to locate any Eighth Circuit published or unpublished
opinion, appellate or district court decisions, where the court has excluded a treating
physician’s testimony about PTSD on the issue of causation or otherwise. Defendants’
motion is not supported by the law.
b.

Defendants’ Claim of “Complete Surprise” is Disingenuous And
Does Not Preclude Testimony By Plaintiff’s Treating Physicians.

Defendants assert they will be greatly prejudiced if Plaintiff’s treating physicians
testify “because any testimony would be a complete surprise . . .”

Defendants’

Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion in Limine to Exclude Expert Testimony
(“Def. Mem.”) at 3. This is not correct.
Defendants had all the existing medical records of Mr. Hixon over six months
before trial, including the medical records of Dr. Shirriff and Ms. Jacobs identifying Mr.
Hixon with PTSD and identifying the traumatic triggering event required for a PTSD
diagnosis as the April 2, 2005 incident.2 (See Edwards Aff., ¶ 3.) Mr. Hixon formally
disclosed to Defendants that he was receiving treatment from BHSI, the employer of both
2

Medical records have been timely supplemented since that time. (See Edwards Aff., ¶
3.)
7

CASE 0:06-cv-01548-RHK-JSM Document 81 Filed 08/23/07 Page 8 of 22

Dr. Shirriff and Ms. Jacobs in written correspondence on January 24, 2007 and provided
signed authorizations to Defendants so they could obtain Mr. Hixon’s medical records.3
(See Edwards Aff., ¶ 4.) Defendants had known of the treatment weeks earlier, on
December 18, 2006, when Mr. Hixon testified about the treatment and identified his
doctors. In addition, Mr. Hixon provided Defendants with a complete copy of all BHSI
medical records available to that date on February 20, 2007, and timely supplemented
them. (See Edwards Aff., ¶¶ 3-4.) The BHSI medical records clearly show both Dr.
Shirriff and Ms. Jacobs had diagnosed Mr. Hixon as suffering from PTSD and
depression.

(See Edwards Aff., Ex. 1, Shirriff Depo., Ex. 36.)

The records also

identified the traumatic triggering event that is a necessary part of a PTSD diagnosis, as
an incident that occurred to Mr. Hixon on April 2, 2005 involving Golden Valley police
officers. (See Edwards Aff., Ex. 1, Shirriff Depo., Ex. 36.) The records further describe
Mr. Hixon’s symptoms, including anxiety, paranoia, agoraphobia, fear that he had almost
lost his life, trouble sleeping, trouble with memory, difficulty in speaking, and a flattened
affect. The records also included information on Mr. Hixon’s treatment. Based on this
information, Defendants were aware in February 2007 that Mr. Hixon was receiving
treatment from Dr. Shirriff and Ms. Jacobs, were aware of his PTSD and depression
diagnoses, were aware of his symptoms, and were aware that the triggering event of Mr.
Hixon’s PTSD was the April 2, 2005 incident.
Defendants were also well aware that Mr. Hixon was suffering from PTSD from
their own expert, Dr. Cris Johnston, who provided Defendants with an assessment of Mr.
3

This was before the discovery deadline of March 1, 2007.
8

CASE 0:06-cv-01548-RHK-JSM Document 81 Filed 08/23/07 Page 9 of 22

Hixon as early as December 19, 2006. Dr. Johnston’s evaluation included a review of
Mr. Hixon’s medical records, a clinical interview, and results of psychological tests
administered by Dr. Johnston. Dr. Johnston not only diagnosed Mr. Hixon with PTSD,
but identified the April 2, 2005 incident with Golden Valley police officers as the
triggering traumatic event of Mr. Hixon’s PTSD. (See Edwards Aff., Ex. 1, Shirriff
Depo., Ex. 37.)

The fact Defendants even retained Dr. Johnston to conduct a

psychological IME evaluation indicates they were not surprised.
Furthermore, Defendants were aware that Mr. Hixon was suffering from PTSD as
long ago as November 28, 2006 when Mr. Hixon produced records and authorizations
from Mr. Hixon’s healthcare providers at Health Partners, including treatment notes of
Ms. Karen Kramer, a mental health professional at Health Partners. Ms. Kramer also
diagnosed Mr. Hixon with PTSD and identified the April 2, 2005 incident with Golden
Valley police officers as the traumatic event that had occurred, a requirement for a PTSD
diagnosis. (See Edwards Aff., Ex. 1, Shirriff Depo., Ex. 34.)
Finally, Mr. Hixon disclosed Dr. Shirriff and Ms. Jacobs as witnesses in a
supplemental Rule 26(a)(1) filing, nearly six months before trial.4 (See Edwards Aff., ¶
5.)
Defendants cannot claim to be “surprised” that Mr. Hixon had been diagnosed
with PTSD and depression, cannot claim they were “surprised” that Mr. Hixon was being
treated for PTSD and depression by Dr. Shirriff and by Ms. Jacobs at BHSI, cannot claim
4

Mr. Hixon produced the required proposed witness and exhibit list, including the names
of Dr. Shirriff and Ms. Jacobs to Defendants on August 17, 2007, as required by the
Court’s Order of July 2, 2007. ¶
9

CASE 0:06-cv-01548-RHK-JSM Document 81 Filed 08/23/07 Page 10 of 22

to be “surprised” that Dr. Shirriff and Ms. Jacobs are witnesses in this case, nor can they
claim they were “surprised” that the traumatic triggering event to Mr. Hixon’s PTSD was
the incident that occurred on April 2, 2005. Under the Federal Rules, Defendants were
free to serve Mr. Hixon with interrogatories concerning the diagnosis, care and treatment
he was receiving from Dr. Shirriff and Ms. Jacobs, but they did not. Defendants were
also free to depose both Dr. Shirriff5 and Ms. Jacobs and inquire into all relevant aspects
of their opinions, treatment and diagnoses, but they did not. Defendants cannot now
claim they did not have a reasonable opportunity to prepare for effective crossexamination. The fact that Defendants chose not to further inquire about the treating
physicians’ opinions (persons they know to be witnesses in this case) cannot be used as a
basis to deny their testimony claiming unfair surprise. See McCloughan, 208 F.R.D., at
242. Defendants’ Motion in Limine appears to be the result of Defendants’ expert
agreeing with all other doctors in this case that Mr. Hixon suffers from chronic PTSD.

Plaintiff’s Treating Physicians May Testify About Causation of PTSD
and Related Depression.
a.

Plaintiff’s Treating Physicians May Testify As To Causation
Without Triggering A Rule 26(a)(2)(B) Report Requirement.

Defendants next seek to limit the treating physicians’ testimony as to causation.
(See Def. Mem. at 4.) This attempt must also be rejected. Defendants’ arguments are
inapplicable because they refuse to recognize that in a case involving treating physician
5

Mr. Hixon chose to depose Dr. Shirriff on August 7, 2007 when it appeared it would be
necessary to have Dr. Shirriff’s testimony at trial come in through deposition. Mr. Hixon
is now able to call Dr. Shirriff as a witness at trial in lieu of using his deposition
testimony.

10

CASE 0:06-cv-01548-RHK-JSM Document 81 Filed 08/23/07 Page 11 of 22

testimony regarding PTSD (and related depression) the triggering traumatic event of the
PTSD is a specific criteria or required element of the diagnosis and is central to
treatment. (See Shirriff Aff., ¶¶ 3-4, 13; Jacobs Aff. ¶¶ 3-4, 10.) The cause of the PTSD
is not ancillary or unimportant to the work of the treating physicians, but rather central
and a part of the diagnosis and treatment.
The prevailing view today is that treating physicians, not specially retained, may
testify about their opinions as to causation without the requirement of a Rule 26(a)(2)(B)
report even in non-PTSD cases. See, e.g., Mackey v. Burlington Northern Santa Fe Ry.
Co., No. 05-4133-SAC, 2006 WL 3512958, *2 (D. Kan. Nov. 29, 2006); Martin v. CSX

Zurba, 202 F.R.D. at 592; Starling v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 203 F.R.D. 468, 479 (D. Kan.
2001); Smith, 2002 WL 1163735, at *3; Sprague v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 177 F.R.D. 78,
81 (D.N.H. 1998); Shapardon v. West Beach Estates, 172 F.R.D. 415, 417 (D. Haw.
1997); Chrisopher W. Dyer, Note, “Treating Physicians: Fact Witnesses or Retained

federal courts considering the issue of whether treating physicians are subject to reporting
requirements when presented to provide opinion testimony on prognosis, causation, or
standard of care, have concluded treating physicians are not subject to these
requirements, so long as the opinions stem from treatment”) (emphasis added).
A treating physician’s opinions about the causation of a medical condition, the
diagnosis, the prognosis and extent of the disability are all considered part of the ordinary
care of a patient. See Smith, 2002 WL 1163735, at *3 (opinions as to causation are part
11

CASE 0:06-cv-01548-RHK-JSM Document 81 Filed 08/23/07 Page 12 of 22

of the ordinary care of a patient); McCloughan, 208 F.R.D. at 242 (doctors need to know
the cause of the injury as part of their treatment); Zurba, 202 F.R.D. at 592 (developing
an opinion as to the cause of an injury is a necessary part of treatment; in addition it is
common for a treating physician to consider patient’s prognosis; such testimony does not
trigger the need for an expert report).
As the McCloughan court noted:
[D]octors do not operate in a vacuum. In order to properly treat and
diagnose a patient, the doctor needs to know, establish, or reach a
conclusion regarding the cause of the patient’s injury. Thus the Court
believes that causation, diagnosis, and prognosis would be based upon the
treating physicians’ personal knowledge of [the patient] and his case.
McCloughan, 208 F.R.D. at 242; see also Shapardon, 172 F.R.D. at 416-17 (opinions as
to the cause of a medical condition, the diagnosis, prognosis and extent of disability are
included in the ordinary care of a patient and do not trigger the need for an expert report).
As long as treating physicians limit their testimony to opinions based on their own
personal care and treatment of the patient, including opinion as to the causation, nature
and projected duration of the patient’s disabilities, no Rule 26(a)(2)(B) report is required.
See Mackey, 2006 WL 3512958, at *2; Goeken v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., No. 99-4191SAC, 2001 WL 1159751 (D.Kan. Aug. 16, 2001) (treating physicians may testify to
prognosis and the extent of present and future disability); Vecchio, 2007 WL 1813578, at

required including testimony as the cause of the medical condition, the diagnosis, the
prognosis and the extent of the disability caused).

12

CASE 0:06-cv-01548-RHK-JSM Document 81 Filed 08/23/07 Page 13 of 22

Permitting a treating physician to testify about causation is particularly appropriate
when the cause of an injury is necessary for diagnosis and treatment. See Starling, 203
F.R.D. at 479 (permitting treating physicians to testify as to causation of PTSD).
Identification of causation is an essential part of the diagnosis and treatment of PTSD.
(See Shirriff Aff., ¶13; Jacobs Aff., ¶10; Edwards Aff., Ex. 1, pp. 32-33.) PTSD is
defined as “an anxiety disorder involving an individual

who has been exposed to,

witnessed, or learned about ‘an extreme traumatic stressor involving direct personal
experience of an event that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury, or other
threat to one’s physical integrity’ that leads to significant symptoms of distress or
impairment in the patient.” (See Jacobs Aff., ¶ 3; Shirriff Aff., ¶ 3.) Patients are not
diagnosed with PTSD unless they have been exposed to an extremely traumatic event that
involves actual or threatened death or serious injury. (See Edwards Aff., Ex. 1, pp. 3233; Shirriff Aff., ¶¶ 3, 13.) This is a direct overlap with the question of cause.
Unlike the diagnosis required for a patient who presents with a broken bone in
their leg and the cause of the injury is likely ancillary, treating physicians who see a
patient presenting with PTSD-like symptoms must determine if the patient has
experienced the extreme type of traumatic event required for a PTSD diagnosis and must
delve into and understand the cause. Furthermore, unlike treatment for a broken leg, it is
important and, in fact, necessary, for a treating physician to understand the cause of a
PTSD patient’s symptoms in order to develop appropriate treatment. (See Shirriff Aff., ¶
13; Jacobs Aff., ¶ 10.) In the case of Mr. Hixon, for example, part of his therapy included
helping him learn coping skills to use when he confronts similar stressors arising from the
13

CASE 0:06-cv-01548-RHK-JSM Document 81 Filed 08/23/07 Page 14 of 22

traumatic event that caused his PTSD, such as seeing police officers and returning to the
gas station where the event occurred. (See Jacobs Aff., ¶ 10.)
In fact, treating physicians have been allowed to testify about causation in PTSD
cases without a Rule 26(a)(2)(B) report. See Starling, 203 F.R.D. at 479; Rogers, 328
F.Supp. at 690. Again, to our knowledge, no court in the Eighth Circuit has precluded
such evidence.
b.

Plaintiff’s Treating Physicians May Testify as to Causation
Under A Daubert6 Analysis.

Defendants assert that Plaintiff’s treating physicians may not testify about
causation under a Daubert analysis because: (1) they were concerned with Mr. Hixon’s
treatment, not investigating the cause; (2) Dr. Shirrif’s opinion on the causation of Mr.
Hixon’s injuries was not based upon a methodology that had been tested, subjected to
peer review, and generally accepted in the medical community; and (3) the treating
physicians did not rule out other possible causes of Mr. Hixon’s PTSD. Def. Mem., at 68. They assert that a Daubert analysis is required for treating physicians who propose to
testify regarding causation. Def. Mem. at 4-5. This argument attempts to divert the
Court from the proper analysis, discussed supra, that treating physicians are not
“experts,” and may testify as fact witnesses including causation testimony in a case such
as PTSD.
Based on the reasons and caselaw cited in the preceding section regarding a Rule
26(a)(2)(B) analysis on causation testimony, this Court need not engage in a Daubert

6

Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., 509 U.S. 573, 591 (1993).
14

CASE 0:06-cv-01548-RHK-JSM Document 81 Filed 08/23/07 Page 15 of 22

analysis since the causation testimony in this case regarding PTSD is not “expert”
testimony. The opinions of Mr. Hixon’s treating physicians that his PTSD was caused by
the incident on April 2, 2005 were required for their diagnoses and necessary for their
treatment of Mr. Hixon. As such, they are fact witnesses, not experts subject to a
Daubert analysis. They are not to be converted into “experts” when their opinion on
causation is central to the diagnosis, as in PTSD.
This distinction is clear when the facts of the Turner and Medalen cases, cited by
Defendants, are examined.

In Turner, the court engaged in a Daubert analysis in

reviewing the exclusion of testimony of plaintiff’s treating physician, a pulmonologist
whose proposed testimony involved an opinion that baking soda inhaled at plaintiff’s
worksite caused her reactive airway disorder. See Turner v. Iowa Fire Equip. Co., 229
F.3d 1202 (8th Cir. 2000). It is not an essential element of the diagnosis of reactive
airway disorder to identify the cause of the injury. Furthermore, it is likely that a reactive
airway disorder could have multiple causes, unlike a traumatic triggering PTSD event. In
fact, the pulmonologist in Turner initially identified a different cause and later changed
his opinion after learning his original causation conclusion was not possible. Id., at 1208.
In Medalen the treating physician acknowledged that he did little to determine the
cause of plaintiff’s skin cancer as it was not important to his treatment. See Medalen v.
Tiger Drylac U.S.A., Inc., 269 F.Supp. 2d 1118, 1137 (D. Minn. 2003). Furthermore, the
treating physician, a plastic surgeon, admitted he did not have expertise in determining
the cause of cancer. The court concluded the treating physician was not competent to

15

CASE 0:06-cv-01548-RHK-JSM Document 81 Filed 08/23/07 Page 16 of 22

testify that plaintiff’s exposure to defendants’ powder paint products caused her basal cell
carcinoma. Id. at 1137-39.
These cases highlight the significant factual differences with Mr. Hixon’s case. In
Mr. Hixon’s case, there is no evidence of multiple, or indeed any other cause of Mr.
Hixon’s PTSD. Moreover, Mr. Hixon’s treating physicians never changed their causation
determination, unlike the treating physician in Turner. Unlike Turner and Medalen, there
was only one possible traumatic event that occurred to Mr. Hixon that could have been
the cause of his PTSD. Dr. Shirriff and Ms. Jacobs are well qualified to identify the types
of traumatic events that might cause PTSD, and they identified the April 2, 2005 incident
as the triggering event, having considered that no other events of such trauma existed nor
were fixated on by Mr. Hixon.7 (See Shirriff Aff., ¶¶ 1, 2, , 13-15; Jacobs Aff., ¶¶ 1, 2,
10-12.) In contrast, the treating physicians in Turner and Medalen acknowledged they
made no effort to determine whether other factors may have caused or contributed to the
disability. Further, there is no evidence the Turner physician was qualified to identify the
cause of a pulmonary disability as a particular chemical agent, or the Medalen physician
was qualified to form an opinion about causation of skin cancer. See Turner, 229 F.3d at
1206; Medalen, 269 F.Supp.2d at 1137.
If this Court should determine that a Daubert analysis is required in this case,
Plaintiff’s treating physicians must still be permitted to testify as to causation.

7

Again, all of this was done as a critical and necessary part of their treatment and wholly
unrelated to any litigation. (See Shirriff Aff., ¶ 6; Jacobs Aff., ¶ 6.)
16

CASE 0:06-cv-01548-RHK-JSM Document 81 Filed 08/23/07 Page 17 of 22

Federal Rule of Evidence 702 governs the admissibility of expert testimony. See
Fed.R.Evid.702.

Even after Daubert, the rule as interpreted by the courts, favors

admissibility of expert testimony rather than exclusion, and “reflects an attempt to
liberalize the rules governing the admission of expert testimony.” See Lauzon v. Senco
Prod., Inc., 270 F.3d 681, 686 (8th Cir. 2001) (quoting Weisgram v. Marley Co., 169 F.3d
514, 523 (8th Cir. 1999) aff’d, 528 U.S. 440 (2000)); Starling, 203 F.R.D. at 476 (“Even
after Daubert, rejection of expert testimony has been the exception rather than the rule”).
Defendants’ first assertion that Mr. Hixon’s treating physicians were concerned
with Mr. Hixon’s treatment, not investigating the cause is, quite simply, totally
inaccurate. As discussed supra, identifying the cause (a traumatic triggering event) was
essential to Dr. Shirriff’s and Ms. Jacobs’s diagnosis of Mr. Hixon’s PTSD. (See Shirriff
Aff., ¶ 13; Jacobs Aff., ¶ 10; Edwards Aff., Ex. 1, pp. 32-33.) There can be no diagnosis
of PTSD without the existence of a defined traumatic triggering event. (See Shirriff Aff.,
¶ 3; Jacobs Aff., ¶ 3. Identifying the cause of Mr. Hixon’s PTSD was also necessary for
Mr. Hixon’s treatment. (See Jacobs Aff., ¶ 10.) Dr. Shirriff and Ms. Jacobs, in fact, were
“concerned” about and did investigate the cause of Mr. Hixon’s PTSD.
Next, Defendant’s question the methodology used by Dr. Shirriff and Ms. Jacobs
to determine causation, suggesting their methodology has not been tested, subjected to
peer review, or generally accepted in the medical community. Attacks regarding the
completeness of methodology of experts go to the weight, not the admissibility of the
testimony. See Kudabeck v. Kroger Co., 338 F.3d 856, 861 (8th Cir. 2003); Lauzon, 270
F.3d at 694. It is well established that “vigorous cross-examination” and the introduction
17

CASE 0:06-cv-01548-RHK-JSM Document 81 Filed 08/23/07 Page 18 of 22

of contrary evidence, not exclusion, are considered the favored methods to use when
attacking testimony one side regards as “shaky.”8

See Kudabeck, 338 F.3d at 862

(quoting Daubert v. Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., 509 U.S. 573 (1993)); Starling, 203
F.R.D. at 862 (same). Moreover, methodology is considered unreliable only where the
defendant points to a plausible alternative cause and the doctor offers no other
explanation. See Kudabeck, 338 F.3d at 862 (quoting Heller v. Shaw Indus., Inc., 167
F.3d 146, 155 (3d Cir. 1999)).

Defendants have not suggested such a plausible

alternative cause, nor can they. This case is akin to a healthy plaintiff getting into a car
accident and coming away with a shattered leg. Alternative cause cannot genuinely be
disputed.
Defendants will be free to cross-examine Dr. Shirriff and Ms. Jacobs on the
methodologies they used to determine causation. The fact is no additional testing was
available that was relevant to assess the cause of Mr. Hixon’s PTSD. (Shirriff Aff., ¶ 15;
Jacobs Aff., ¶ 12.) Both Dr. Shirriff and Ms. Jacobs state that based on their education,
training and experience, the April 2, 2005 incident is the type of traumatic event that can
trigger PTSD symptoms. (See Shirriff Aff., ¶ 13; Jacobs Aff., ¶ 12.) Dr. Shirriff and Ms.
Jacobs based their diagnosis that the April 2, 2005 incident caused the PTSD symptoms
in Mr. Hixon on their own extensive professional experience and training, the absence of

8

Defendants cannot use the fact that they did not depose Plaintiff’s two treating
physicians, even though they were fully notified of them as witnesses and had all medical
records to prepare a “vigorous cross-examination,” as a basis to claim prejudice.
Moreover, Defendants’ decision not to use their own expert (who also diagnosed Mr.
Hixon with “chronic PTSD”) cannot be used to claim prejudice or inability to introduce
contrary evidence.
18

CASE 0:06-cv-01548-RHK-JSM Document 81 Filed 08/23/07 Page 19 of 22

other traumatic triggering events, Mr. Hixon’s continuing repeated nightmares about the
April 2, 2005 incident (to the exclusion of nightmares about other events), and his newlyacquired acute fears of police officers related to the event. (See Shirriff Aff., ¶ 15; Jacobs
Aff., ¶ 12.)
Identifying the cause or triggering traumatic event in the case of a PTSD patient is
frequently apparent. (See Jacobs Aff., ¶ 10; Shirriff Aff., ¶ 13.) Identifying a single
triggering, traumatic event that is sufficiently significant to result in PTSD symptoms is
not complicated, such as identifying the cause of fibromyalgia. (Id.) Both Dr. Shirriff
and Ms. Jacobs state that Mr. Hixon’s PTSD diagnosis was not a close-call, and that no
additional testing was available that was relevant to determine the diagnosis or to assess
the cause of Mr. Hixon’s PTSD. (See Shirriff Aff., ¶¶ 12, 15; Jacobs Aff., ¶¶ 9, 12.) In
his deposition, Dr. Shirriff testified he had no doubt at all that the April 2, 2005 incident
was the cause or triggering traumatic event of Mr. Hixon’s PTSD.

[Objection interposed; language omitted.]

It was his experience with the police in April of, is

(Shirriff Depo., at 40-41.)
If Defendants wish to question the methodology used by Dr. Shirriff and Ms.
Jacobs in determining causation, they may do so through cross-examination.
Finally, Defendants err in asserting Dr. Shirriff and Ms. Jacobs did not rule out
other causes.

Defendants describe at length Dr. Shirriff’s testimony regarding

“perception.” (See Def. Mem. at 7-8.) Mr. Hixon does not seek testimony from Dr.
Shirriff and Ms. Jacobs about details of Mr. Hixon’s description of the events that
occurred to him on April 2, 2005. The issue for purposes of diagnosis is what trauma Mr.
Hixon experienced and whether he could perceive it as a life threatening or serious injury
type of trauma. Here, he certainly could and did.
Reliable causation testimony need not rule out every possible alternative cause.
See Kudabeck, 338 F.3d at 861 (citing Lauzon, 270 F.3d at 693-94). Secondly, and more
importantly, Dr. Shirriff and Ms. Jacobs both considered whether there were other
significant traumatic events that could result in a diagnosis of PTSD and found none.
They state no other traumatic events or injuries were disclosed by Mr. Hixon, his wife or
his medical records. (See Shirriff Aff., ¶¶ 9, 12-16; Jacobs Aff., ¶¶ 7, 9-12.) Dr. Shirriff
testified in his deposition that non-life-threatening financial or marital problems could not
be the cause of PTSD. (See Shirriff Depo. at 82.) Defendants’ challenge based on a

20

CASE 0:06-cv-01548-RHK-JSM Document 81 Filed 08/23/07 Page 21 of 22

purported requirement to eliminate other causes is both factually inaccurate and
inappropriate to this PTSD case.

Issue of Use of Deposition Testimony of Dr. Shirriff At Trial.

Mr. Hixon intends to call Dr. Shirriff as a witness at trial.
B.

EXPERT TESTIMONY ON LIABILITY – ANTHONY BOUZA.
Defendants admit that Plaintiff timely disclosed former Minneapolis Police Chief

Anthony Bouza as a rebuttal expert on the use of police force, and timely served
Defendants with Chief Bouza’s Expert Report.9 Defendants also do not argue that Chief
Bouza, whose experience in law enforcement spans 50 years, lacks the requisite
qualifications to provide expert testimony on police use of force.

Notwithstanding,

Defendants argue, without legal or factual support, that Chief Bouza should be barred
from providing expert testimony in this case.10
Because Chief Bouza is amply qualified, and because Plaintiff timely disclosed
him and provided his report to Defendants, there can be no dispute that he should be
permitted to testify on Plaintiff’s behalf in this case. (See the Court’s Pretrial Scheduling
Order (stating “Each party may call all disclosed experts at trial”).) In the interest of
judicial economy, Plaintiff requests the Court’s leave to call Chief Bouza in his case in
chief. At a minimum, however, Plaintiff must be allowed to call Chief Bouza in rebuttal
9

Defendants’ Memorandum states, presumably in error, that the deadline for expert
disclosures contained in the Pretrial Scheduling Order was January 5, 2007. In fact, the
deadline for disclosure of rebuttal experts was February 1, 2007, the same date that expert
reports were due, and the date on which Plaintiff served notice of Chief Bouza as an
expert witness and provided Defendants with his report.
10
(See pp. 9-10, Defendants’ Memorandum of Law In Support of Motion in Limine to
Exclude Expert Testimony.)
21

CASE 0:06-cv-01548-RHK-JSM Document 81 Filed 08/23/07 Page 22 of 22

to respond to the representations of any defense witness, including defense expert Scott
Bechtold, about the legitimacy of Defendants’ use of force in arresting Plaintiff.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing reasons, Mr. Hixon respectfully requests that this Court
reject Defendants’ Motion in Limine to exclude the testimony at trial of Dr. Shirriff, Ms.
Jacobs, and Mr. Bouza.
