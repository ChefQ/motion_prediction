Defendants Trump Panama Hotel Management LLC and Trump International Hotels
Management, LLC (“Defendants”), by and through their undersigned counsel, respectfully submit this
Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction.1
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
This dispute, and the underlying arbitration commenced by affiliates controlled by Plaintiffs,
-- all of whom are represented by the same attorneys who represent Plaintiffs here -- arise out of
Plaintiffs’ fraud and conspiracy to injure Defendants’ rights under a hotel management agreement (the
“HMA”) for the Trump Panama International Hotel (the “Hotel”). The HMA contains a broad
international arbitration clause under the auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce
(“ICC”). The facts before this Court, as controlled by the law of the Second Circuit, bind the Plaintiffs
here to the HMA arbitration clause. Moreover, the ICC rules to which the Plaintiffs are bound
specifically call for the ICC itself to decide issues of joinder of additional parties to the arbitration.
Defendants joined Plaintiffs in the arbitration on December 4, 2016. Plaintiffs subsequently asked the
ICC to stay its adjudication of the joinder issue, however the ICC declined Plaintiffs’ application for
a stay and the issue of joinder is sub judice with the ICC. On this basis alone Plaintiffs’ Motion should
be denied.
Furthermore: All of the facts and events giving rise to Defendants’ injuries and claims asserted
in the Arbitration took place in Panama City, Panama; nearly all, if not all, of the witnesses and
documents are located in Panama City, Panama; Plaintiff Fintiklis executed and caused to be issued
both the Notice of Default and Notice of Termination to Defendants under the HMA that is the
subject of the Arbitration; Plaintiffs caused the pending ICC international arbitration to be
commenced against Defendants by and through two Panamanian entities they control; the HMA
arbitration clause requires the evidentiary hearing to take place in Panama City, Panama. Plaintiffs
Ithaca I and Ithaca II are Panamanian entities formed by a Cypriot attorney, Plaintiff Orestes Fintiklis
Defendants submit this Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion (the “Motion” or Mot.) before their
time to respond to the Complaint in this action has expired (which deadline, by agreement of the parties, is currently
February 23, 2018). By submission of this Memorandum, Defendants do not waive – and, indeed, expressly reserve – all
defenses, objections and/or counterclaims they may have to the Complaint, which will be asserted in due course pursuant
to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12, in the event the Court does not dispose of this Action consistent with Defendants’ instant opposition.

Case 1:18-cv-00390-ER Document 25 Filed 02/20/18 Page 8 of 31

(“Fintiklis”). Ithaca I and Ithaca II were formed by Fintiklis in Panama for the purpose of furthering
a fraud and usurping unlawful control over Hotel TOC, Inc., the Panamanian corporation that “owns”
the Hotel. Critically, the Hotel bears Defendants’ trademarks and tradenames and is lawfully managed
by Defendants under the HMA.
Plaintiffs knew that the HMA and several hotel-related agreements required Defendants’
written consent as a condition for Plaintiffs to purchase in bulk 215 hotel units and thereby obtain
Plaintiffs’ effective control over the Hotel. Simply put, Defendants had the absolute right to block
that bulk sale precisely to prevent parties like Plaintiffs from gaining outsized control over the asset
and then maliciously injuring Defendants’ rights under the HMA by engaging in the exact conduct at
issue here for which Defendants sued Plaintiffs in the Arbitration. Thus as a condition to granting
consent to Plaintiffs’ acquisition of 215 hotel units, Plaintiffs entered into a written agreement which
provides that, upon acquisition, they would not take any action against Defendants relating to their
management of the Hotel under the HMA. A few weeks after signing that agreement, the Plaintiffs
conspired to do just that. The Bulk Sale Consent Agreement Sec. 3 (D) provides:
Purchaser shall not, directly or indirectly through any Affiliates or otherwise: (w) take
(or refrain from taking) any action (including any legal action) that would interfere with
or undermine the rights or obligations of Operator under and in respect of any of the
Hotel Agreements, (x) exercise its vote with respect to any of the Hotel Units in any
Owners Meeting or other constituent body of the P.H. TOC (or any of its
components), including without limitation, Hotel TOC Inc., in any manner which is
adverse to the interests of Operator and/or its Affiliates under and in respect of any
of the Hotel Agreements, (y) take (or refrain from taking) any action (including any
legal action) that could materially damage the relationship between Operator, its
Affiliates and any other Person or (z) make, issue, solicit or endorse any statement that
would damage or undermine the reputation of Operator or any of its Affiliates.
Ex. 2.2 Recitals B and C, together with Paragraph 3, of the Bulk Sale Consent Agreement expressly
incorporate the HMA and all Hotel-related agreements: Plaintiffs intentionally failed to address the
import of these clauses in making the instant motion to enjoin the arbitration which they caused to be
commenced against Defendants, hoping the deflect the Court’s attention from the material facts.
Soon after purchasing the 215 units in bulk and executing the restrictive Bulk Sale Consent

Case 1:18-cv-00390-ER Document 25 Filed 02/20/18 Page 9 of 31

Agreement, Plaintiffs’ conspiracy to injure Defendants’ rights under the HMA went into action. On
October 14, 2017, Plaintiffs: 1) under knowingly false pretenses of calling a “lunch meeting,” held
two so-called “Board Meetings” in Panama despite lack of notice to Defendants’ representatives on
the Boards; caused Defendants’ representatives to be excluded from the alleged “Board” meetings;
and claimed to hold “votes” whereby they (of course) installed themselves as corporate officers
claiming to have effective control of the Panama corporation that owns the Hotel; 2) simultaneously,
that same day Plaintiffs sent a bogus Notice of Default – pre-executed by Plaintiff Orestes Fintikilis
as an “authorized representative of Hotel TOC, Inc.,” by which he purported to default Defendants
under the HMA, (see Ex. 17) ; 3) on that same day Plaintiffs, by and through Fintiklis, caused Hotel
TOC, which Plaintiffs control, to commence the ICC Arbitration against Defendants under the HMA,
(despite that the Notice of Default contains a 30 day cure period as required under the HMA) (see Ex.
8) ; and 4) after commencing an arbitration seeking, among other things, a declaration that a default
existed under the HMA, Plaintiffs caused a bogus notice of termination to be sent under the HMA
purporting to oust Defendants as Operator of the Hotel. (see Ex. 18).
Six weeks after Defendants asserted their third party claims against Plaintiffs in the ICC
arbitration, based on the same facts as set forth above, Plaintiffs moved this Court seeking to enjoin
the ICC proceedings so as to prejudice Defendants with bifurcated proceedings here. Having not
sought any interim relief from this Court by way of TRO or even Order to Show Cause, Plaintiffs
instead wrote to the ICC requesting that it stay the issue of joinder as to Plaintiffs and not permit the
arbitration to proceed as against Plaintiffs. The ICC denied Plaintiffs’ request. As noted above, the
issue is sub judice with the ICC. Ex. 10, February 2, 2018 Letter from ICC.
Plaintiffs’ motion should be denied because: (i) the HMA, as a matter of law, binds the
Plaintiffs to the ICC arbitration on the facts at bar; (ii) the ICC has jurisdiction to decide the issue of
joinder and is the proper juridical body to decide the interrelated disputes falling squarely under the
HMA and its broad arbitration clause; (iii) revealing a desire to forum shop and delay their own
arbitration, Plaintiffs brought this action six weeks after having notice of their joinder in the ICC
arbitration a fatal delay; (iv) this instant action lacks subject matter jurisdiction and even if subject
3

Case 1:18-cv-00390-ER Document 25 Filed 02/20/18 Page 10 of 31

matter jurisdiction existed, the Complaint fails to state a claim cognizable for which relief may be
granted under the Panama Convention; (v) Plaintiffs fail to meet the amount in controversy threshold
for bringing claims under diversity jurisdiction in the federal courts, and cannot overcome this hurdle
by reference to the third party claims asserted by Defendants against Plaintiffs in the ICC arbitration;
and (vi) Plaintiffs should not be permitted to conflate the narrow question before this Court whether
an agreement to arbitrate exists and reasonably binds certain non-signatories with a host of other
questions of arbitrability that are explicitly reserved to the ICC under the law of this Circuit. The
parties to this Action are bound to arbitrate pursuant to the language of the HMA and the law of this
Circuit.
Finally, where Plaintiffs Ithaca I and II are Panamanian corporations, and where Fintiklis is a
Cypriot attorney who controls the Hotel by and through Panamanian entities, this Court should
respectfully take judicial notice that Plaintiffs are asking this Court to hold that they are not bound to
arbitrate in the ICC, despite the fact that the courts in Panama, which have jurisdiction over the parties
and the Hotel the subject matter of the arbitration – cannot as a matter of law enjoin the ICC
arbitration as against Plaintiffs pursuant to the Panama Constitution: Panama recognizes and enforces
competence-competence pursuant to its Constitution. See Political Constitution of the Republic of Panama,
Article 202. Plaintiffs’ forum shopping offends principles of international comity and should be
denied.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
Plaintiffs control the Hotel located in Panama City, Panama, by and through their control of
two entities: 1) Hotel TOC, Inc. a Panamanian corporation which is the “Owner” of the Hotel, and
2) Hotel TOC Foundation, which is a Panamanian entity which is the sole shareholder of Hotel TOC,
Inc. See Ex. 12, Hotel TOC Foundation Charter; Ex. 13, Hotel TOC, Inc. Articles of Incorporation.
Hotel TOC, Inc. is also the Claimant which Plaintiffs caused to commence the ICC arbitration against
Defendants. The Hotel, together with Defendants’ rights under the HMA, comprise the subject
matter of all disputes between Plaintiffs and Defendants in the ICC. The Defendants and Hotel TOC,

4

Case 1:18-cv-00390-ER Document 25 Filed 02/20/18 Page 11 of 31

Inc. are bound to arbitration in the ICC by and through the HMA.3 Hotel TOC, Inc. is represented
in the ICC arbitration by Plaintiffs’ instant counsel, Akerman.
As incorporated by reference and attached as exhibits in the Bulk Sale Consent Agreement,
the Hotel is operated pursuant to a network of coordinated agreements between and among numerous
parties. These agreements all reference, rely on and subject Hotel Unit owners and parties to the HMA
to a series of constitutional agreements and documents governing the Hotel and its ownership
structure, including the Co-Ownership Regulations, the House Rules and the Hotel Management
Agreement (“HMA”). Plaintiffs, and ICC Claimant Hotel TOC, Inc., which Plaintiffs control,
together with Defendants and other third party respondents joined by Defendants in the ICC are
bound by the HMA; all the hotel-related agreements all contain the identical ICC arbitration clause:
Unless otherwise specifically provided for in this Agreement, all disputes,
controversies, claims or disagreements arising out of or relating ot this Agreement
(singularly, a “Dispute”, and collectively, “Disputes”) shall be resolved in the following
manner. . . Either Party may submit the Dispute to the International Chamber of
Commerce for binding arbitration under the then existing ICC Commercial
Arbitration Rules.
Ex. 1, HMA, § 9.1 (emphasis added); see also Ex. 4 Hotel Unit Rental Management Agreement
(“HURMA”), § 8.21; Ex. 4, Hotel Unit Maintenance Agreement (“HUMA”), § 19(j); Ex. 5, Hotel
Amenities Units Lease Agreement (“HAULA”), § 16(i); Ex. 3, Co-Ownership Regulations of the P.H.
TOC Building (“COR”), Article 86.
The dispute resolution mechanism upon which the entire Hotel property ownership and
management structure relies (including all persons having any interests in the Hotel or any Hotel
Unit/Hotel Amenities Unit therein) is binding arbitration before the ICC. Indeed, the Hotel-related
agreements, including the HMA – each of which are incorporated by reference and attached to the
Bulk Sale Consent Agreement – seek to establish an orderly international arbitration in Panama City
of all related claims before the ICC, and requires parties “to submit all Disputes then known to that
3 The HMA and other relevant documents are annexed to the accompanying Declaration of Perry M. Amsellem
(“Amsellem Dec.”). The facts underlying the dispute between Defendants and Plaintiffs in arbitration are set for the
Defendants’ responsive pleading submitted in the ICC and annexed to the Amsellem Dec. at Ex. 8. To the extent possible,
Defendants here will seek to limited the repetition of those facts and respectfully refer the Court to Ex. 8 for the facts
concerning the dispute pending before the ICC.

Case 1:18-cv-00390-ER Document 25 Filed 02/20/18 Page 12 of 31

party within the same arbitration proceeding and any such claim that is not submitted shall be barred.” Ex. 1,
HMA, § 9.1.1; Ex. 4, HURMA, § 8.21; Ex. 5, HUMA, § 19(j); Ex. 6, HAULA, § 16(i); Ex. 16, License
Agreement with Owners Meeting and Hotel TOC, Inc. (“License Agreement”), § 20(a). In short,
this Court should take judicial notice that if Defendants here had not asserted its third party
claims against Plaintiffs in the ICC Arbitration, such claims would have been waived under
the HMA.
On or about October 14, 2017, Plaintiffs, by and through the Panamanian entity they control,
Hotel TOC, Inc., commenced an arbitration before the ICC, alleging that Defendants had breached
the HMA, and seeking declaratory relief along with damages. See Ex. 8. On or about December 4,
2017, Defendants responded with their Answer, Counterclaims and Request for Joinder asserting third
party claims against Plaintiffs, among others, with all third party claims arising out of or related to the
HMA.4 The facts leading up to and including the October 14, 2017 Notice for Termination, and
Demand for Arbitration underscore the propriety of the ICC arbitration as against Plaintiffs.
A. Plaintiffs Surreptitiously Take Control of Hotel Owner and Claimant Hotel TOC,
Inc. By and Through the Bulk Sale Consent Agreement
In October 2016, Fintiklis sought to purchase in bulk 215 Hotel related Units. Pursuant to,
inter alia, the Co-Ownership Regulations governing the Hotel (which includes the same arbitration
clause as in the HMA), Plaintiffs were required to obtain Defendants’ written consent as a condition
to the sale of more than 10 Hotel Units. On or about February 15, 2017, Defendants and Plaintiffs
agreed to the terms of Defendants’ consent to the bulk sale by Newland, a Panamanian corporation,
to Plaintiffs. Fintiklis created two Panamanian corporations to accomplish this purchase from
Newland – Plaintiffs Ithaca I and Ithaca II.
Fintiklis signed the Bulk Sale Consent Agreement and it contained an exhibit enumerating all
of the Hotel-related agreements, including the HMA; the Bulk Sale Consent Agreement specifically
Article 7 of the ICC Rules clearly provides for the joinder of additional parties, which Defendants filed as against Plaintiffs
on December 4, 2017. Likewise, Article 6 of the ICC Rules provide a procedure by which participants may raise “pleas
concerning the existence, validity or scope of the arbitration agreement,” with such pleas to be decided by the arbitral
tribunal or, upon reference, by the 17-member International Court of Arbitration of the ICC, whereupon the arbitration
“shall proceed if and to the extent that the Court is prima facie satisfied that an arbitration agreement under the [ICC Rules]
may exist.” ICC Rules, Article 6(4), attached hereto as Ex. 11.

Case 1:18-cv-00390-ER Document 25 Filed 02/20/18 Page 13 of 31

bound Ithaca I and Ithaca II to the terms of such agreements. Moreover, the Bulk Sale Consent
Agreement required Ithaca I to execute, as is required of all Hotel Unit owners, a Hotel Unit
Maintenance Agreement and Hotel Unit Rental Management Agreement. Ex. 2, § 2(A)-(B). Together
with the HMA, each of these agreements provided for binding arbitration before the ICC of any
disputes arising under or related to the HMA. Finally, Plaintiffs Ithaca I and Ithaca II further agreed
to “not . . . take (or refrain from taking) any action (including any legal action) that would interfere
with or undermine the rights or obligations of Operator [Defendants] under and in respect of any the
Hotel Agreements.” Ex. 2, § 3(D). Likewise, the parties agreed that Ithaca I and Ithaca II “shall not
seek or accept an appointment or election to the position of manager or administrator (or other similar
leadership role) of the P.H. TOC [which includes the Hotel].” Ex. 2, § 3(F).
The Bulk Sale Consent Agreement has a narrow forum selection clause which provides that
all actions with respect to [the Bulk Sale Consent Agreement] shall be brought in the State of New
York. Ex. 2, § 9. The Bulk Sale Consent Agreement contains a merger clause expressly limited only
to the parties thereto, and providing, in relevant part, that the agreement “sets forth the entire
understanding and agreement of the Parties hereto and any other agreements or understandings
(written or oral) among the Parties on or prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to the
matters set forth herein.” Ex. 2, § 12. The Bulk Sale Consent Agreement does not abrogate or
repudiate the binding arbitration dispute resolution mechanisms of any of the Hotel-related
agreements; instead, it specifically incorporates them by reference and attaches them. It was manifestly
clear that upon obtaining the permission of the Defendants to purchase in bulk 215 units in the Hotel,
that any and all disputes, controversies, claims or disagreements arising out of or relating to the HMA,
including the management of the Hotel and Defendants’ rights as Hotel Operator, were subject to
binding arbitration before the ICC under Article 9 of the HMA.
B. Plaintiffs Close on the Bulk Sale and Immediately Stage a Coup in Panama
Plaintiffs closed on their purchase of 215 Units on July 30, 2017; the deeds evidencing those
transactions were recorded in Panama on August 10, 2017. Fintiklis then reached out to the Hotel

7

Case 1:18-cv-00390-ER Document 25 Filed 02/20/18 Page 14 of 31

unit owners, falsely claiming to have a “lunch meeting.” In reality, the October 14, 2017 “luncheon”
was anything but. Fintiklis commenced the meeting with a barrage of untrue and slanderous criticisms
of Defendants, and then turned the floor over to his attorneys Morgan & Morgan, P.A, who then
falsely informed the Beneficiaries, i.e., those Hotel unit owners which happened to be in attendance,
that Morgan & Morgan legally represented all of the Beneficiaries of Hotel TOC Foundation. That
statement was demonstrably false, as Morgan & Morgan, P.A. had not been retained by Hotel TOC
Foundation or its Beneficiaries at the time; indeed, at that time Defendants’ representative Roger
Khafif was President of the Hotel TOC Foundation Council with sole authority to hire counsel for
Hotel TOC Foundation – and he was not even present for Plaintiffs’ unlawful takeover, posing as a
lunch meeting.
Morgan & Morgan then proceeded to eject Defendants’ representatives from the meeting, in
order to discuss alleged “privileged” information. Following that discussion, a supposed vote of Hotel
TOC Foundation was purportedly held in the absence of its President roger Khafif whereby Plaintiffs
caused three Foundation Council members to be unlawfully removed (unsurprisingly, all associated
with Defendants), and Plaintiff caused three new Foundation Council members to be appointed, one
of whom was Fintiklis himself. Ex. 14, Hotel TOC Foundation Minutes of October 14, 2017 Meeting.
Furthermore on October 14, 2017, Plaintiffs caused Fintiklis to be named as “President” of the ICC
Claimant’s Board of Directors. Ex. 15, Hotel TOC, Inc. Minutes of October 14, 2017 Meeting. In
addition, at that purported meeting, the Beneficiaries of Hotel TOC Foundation (which Ithaca I and
Ithaca II control) passed “a resolution that authorized the Foundation to take all steps necessary to
terminate [Defendants’] management of [the Hotel]. . . which included, among other things,
commencing an arbitration before the ICC as provided under the HMA.” Compl. ¶ 30. In other
words, the beneficial shareholders of Hotel TOC Foundation, including Ithaca I and Ithaca
II, knowingly voted their interests to pursue an arbitration against Defendants before the ICC;
by doing so, Ithaca I and Ithaca II obtained direct benefits under the HMA and further bound
themselves to the HMA and its broad arbitration clause.
Late that same October 14, 2017, Defendants received a Notice of Default from Hotel TOC,
8

Case 1:18-cv-00390-ER Document 25 Filed 02/20/18 Page 15 of 31

Inc., signed by Fintiklis as its “Authorized Representative,” asserting baseless and, for purposes of this
action, irrelevant, grounds for default. Ex. 18. Later that same October 14, 2017, Plaintiffs caused a
Request for Arbitration to be filed against Defendants in the ICC by Morgan & Morgan, P.A. and
Akerman LLP (Plaintiffs’ counsel here), on behalf of Hotel TOC Inc. Ex. 8.
LEGAL STANDARDS
I.

The Arbitration Agreement Refers All Questions of Arbitrability to the ICC
The Supreme Court has unequivocally held that when an arbitration agreement submits all

disputes arising under the agreement to arbitration, questions of “arbitrability,” and the scope of the
arbitration provision are for the arbitral tribunal to decide, not the court. First Options of Chicago, Inc. v.
Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 944 (1995); Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U.S. 79, 84 (2002). It is well
established in this District that “federal policy and New York law strongly favor arbitration agreements,
broadly interpreting the clauses that authorize arbitration.” Mina v. Foot Locker, Inc., No. 09 CIV. 0472
(DAB), 2009 WL 3241551, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2009); see also Hartford Acc., and Indemn. Co. v. Swiss
Reins. America Corp., 246 F.3d 219, 226 (2d Cir. 2001) (“the existence of an arbitration agreement is
undisputed, doubts as to whether a claim falls within the scope of that agreement should be resolved
in favor of arbitrability”).
The strong policy in favor of arbitration is even stronger where, as here, the arbitration clause
broadly refers to arbitration of “all disputes arising out of an agreement” and is not limited by reference
to the signatories. Clarendon Nat’l Ins. Co. v. Lan, 152 F. Supp. 2d 506, 514 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (holding
that because the dispute at issue “touch[ed] matters” covered by the arbitration agreement, which
contained a broad “all disputes arising out this agreement” language, the non-signatories were required
to arbitrate the dispute).
Here, Section 9.1 of the HMA clearly submits “all disputes, controversies, claims, or
disagreements arising out of or relating to this Agreement . . .” to ICC Arbitration. Such broad
language, which on its face is not limited to the parties of the HMA, has been held to encompass nonsignatories. Thus, once this Court is satisfied that the Plaintiffs are bound to the HMA, because
Defendant’s claims against Plaintiffs in the ICC Arbitration clearly “touch matters” related to the
9

Case 1:18-cv-00390-ER Document 25 Filed 02/20/18 Page 16 of 31

obligations, rights, and performance of the HMA, they must be resolved in arbitration.
II.

Plaintiffs Cannot Show a Clear and Substantial Likelihood of Success on the Merits
Preliminary injunctions are one of “‘the most drastic tools in the arsenal of judicial remedies,’”

and must be used with great care. Accenture LLP v. Spreng, No. 10 CIV 9393 VM, 2010 WL 5538384,
at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2010) (quoting Grand River Enter. Six Nations, Ltd. v. Pryor, 481 F.3d 60, 66
(2d Cir. 2007)). A party seeking a preliminary injunction has the burden of demonstrating “(1)
irreparable harm absent injunctive relief; (2) either a likelihood of success on the merits, or a serious
question going to the merits to make them a fair ground for trial,5 with a balance of hardships tipping
decidedly in the movant’s favor; and (3) that the public’s interest weighs in favor of granting an
injunction.” Transcience Corp. v. Big Time Toys, LLC, 50 F. Supp. 3d 441, 457 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (Ramos,
J.) (citing Red Earth LLC v. United States, 657 F.3d 138, 143 (2d Cir. 2011)). Where, as here, Plaintiffs
seek a preliminary injunction “alter[ing], rather than maintain[ing], the status quo,” Plaintiffs “must
meet the more rigorous standard of demonstrating a ‘clear’ and ‘substantial’ showing of likelihood of
success on the merits.” Alamontaser v. New York City Dep’t of Educ., 519 F.3d 505, 508 (2d Cir. 2008)
(quoting Tom Doherty Assocs., Inc. v. Saban Entm’t, Inc., 60 F.3d 27, 33-34 (2d Cir. 1995)). Where this
Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, and where the Complaint fails to state a claim for
which this Court may grant relief consistent with the Panama Convention, Plaintiffs cannot make
“‘clear’ and ‘substantial’ showing of likelihood of success on the merits” as required to alter the status
quo before the ICC.
III.

Anti-Arbitration Injunctions are Unavailable under the Panama Convention
A preliminary injunction is inappropriate here because 1) this Court lacks subject matter

jurisdiction over the action and 2) the Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.
Indeed, while the Motion asserts that “[f]ederal courts routinely enjoin arbitrations,” such assertion –
as applied to the international arbitration at issue here – is plainly wrong. This international ICC
arbitration will be heard in Panama, between parties a majority of whom are citizens of states having
Plaintiffs’ Motion makes arguments only concerning their likelihood of success on the merits, which is the basis on which
Defendants submit the instant Memorandum in Opposition.
5

Case 1:18-cv-00390-ER Document 25 Filed 02/20/18 Page 17 of 31

ratified the Panama Convention and concerns the management of a hotel in Panama City, Panama.
Thus, this Court must adhere to the Panama Convention, applying Chapter 1 of the FAA (which is
applicable to domestic arbitrations) only “to the extent chapter 1 is not in conflict with this chapter
or the [Panama Convention] as ratified by the United States.” 9 U.S.C. § 307.
Plaintiffs’ Motion cites no authority for the issuance of anti-arbitration injunctions directed at
international arbitrations governed by the Panama Convention; indeed, as discussed infra, such
injunctions are contrary to the limited remedies provided by the Panama Convention and
inappropriate. Rather, Plaintiffs’ Motion relies upon decisions enjoining domestic FINRA arbitrations,
pursuant to Chapter 1 of the FAA, which is utterly irrelevant to the ICC arbitration at-issue in this
action. See Motion at 12-13 (citing Bremis, Corp. v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc., No. CV-114934 (LDW), 2012 WL 760564, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 8, 2012) and Applied Energetics, Inc. v. NewOak
Capital Mkts., LLC, 645 F.3d 522, 525-26 (2d Cir. 2011), both concerning domestic FINRA
arbitrations).
ARGUMENT
I.

The Court Lacks Subject Matter Jurisdiction over this Action
Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, and subject matter jurisdiction is the

touchstone of this Court’s authority to act. See Sheldon v. Sill, 49 U.S. 441 (1850). Plaintiffs seek
declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a), respectively.
Neither alleged basis for relief provides this Court with federal subject matter jurisdiction over the
action. See Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U.S. 667, 671 (1950) (“‘The operation of the
Declaratory Judgment Act is procedural only.’ Congress enlarged the range of remedies available in
federal court but did not extend their jurisdiction.”) (quoting Aetna Life Ins. Co. of Hartford Conn. v.
Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 240 (1937)). Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ Motion should be denied for the simple
reason that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.6
6
The United States and Panama are both signatories to the Panama Convention. Pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 202 (applicable
to the Panama Convention by virtue of 9 U.S.C. § 302), “An agreement or award arising out of such a relationship which
is entirely between citizens of the United States shall be deemed not to fall under the [Panama] Convention unless that
relationship involves property located abroad, envisages performance or enforcement abroad, or has some other
reasonable relation with one or more foreign states.” Here, even if all the participants in the arbitration were U.S. citizens

11

Case 1:18-cv-00390-ER Document 25 Filed 02/20/18 Page 18 of 31

The Complaint purports to identify two, independent bases for original federal subject matter
jurisdiction over this action – diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1332, and federal question jurisdiction,
28 U.S.C. § 1331. See Compl. ¶¶ 18-19. Each is inapplicable to the instant action, and no other bases
of original federal subject matter jurisdiction exist. Accordingly, dismissal of this action is warranted
and, consequently, a preliminary injunction is inappropriate.7
First, while the parties are completely diverse in their citizenship, the amount in controversy
requirements of 28 U.S.C. § 1332 have not been met. The Complaint attempts to satisfy the amount
in controversy by bootstrapping the $150,000,000 in counterclaims asserted by Defendants in the ICC
arbitration; however, such counterclaims are not part of the case or controversy presented by this
action.
Instead, Plaintiffs’ Complaint seeks equitable relief a declaration concerning where the parties
must resolve their disputes – in the federal courts of New York or before the ICC. Plaintiffs’
Complaint does not satisfy the amount in controversy requirement. The location of where Plaintiffs
must litigate their disputes is clearly the “object of litigation,” and its value is zero. See Correspondent
Services Corp. v. First Equities of Florida, 442 F.3d 767, 769 (2d Cir. 2006) (affirming the dismissal of an
action where the “object of the litigation” has no value) (quoting Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Adver.
Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 347 (1977)); Compl. ¶ 11 (action brought to “seek a declaration that the Bulk
Sale Agreement requires [Defendants] to assert [their] claims against Plaintiffs . . . in the state and
federal courts of the State of New York and to enjoin [Defendants] from asserting those claims in the
ongoing Arbitration”). Lacking the requisite amount in controversy, this action does not give rise to
subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332 and must be dismissed. Tongkook Am., Inc. v. Shipton
Sportswear Co., 14 F.3d 781 (2d Cir. 1994) (vacating district court order and remanding case to be
dismissed for want of federal subject matter jurisdiction in light of plaintiff’s failure to satisfy amount
– which they are not – the Panama Convention would nonetheless apply given the significant relationship to foreign
property.
7 These arguments concerning subject matter jurisdiction are presented herein in order to demonstrate the baselessness
of Plaintiffs’ Motion and the lack of success on the merits. Plaintiffs reserve the right to expand upon this argument in
their response to the Complaint, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), along with any other defenses, objections and/or
counterclaims the Defendants may assert, if deemed necessary by this Court.

12

Case 1:18-cv-00390-ER Document 25 Filed 02/20/18 Page 19 of 31

in controversy requirements).
Second, Plaintiffs’ Complaint improperly relies upon the existence of two counterclaims (out of
13) asserted by Defendants in the ICC arbitration under the Federal Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations (RICO) Act, and improperly argues that they give rise to federal question jurisdiction
under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.8 Compl. ¶¶ 8-9. In either case, the counterclaims asserted by Defendants in
arbitration are not part of the case or controversy presented to this Court by the Complaint and the
relief demanded therein, and cannot serve as a basis of subject matter jurisdiction. As the Supreme
Court reiterated in Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Texaco, 415 U.S. 125, 128 (1974):
This Court has repeatedly held that, in order for a claim to arise ‘under the Constitution,
laws, or treaties of the United States,’ a right or immunity created by the Constitution
or the laws of the United States must be an element, and an essential one, of the
plaintiff’s cause of action. The federal questions must be disclosed upon the face of
the complaint, unaided by the answer. Moreover, the complaint itself will not avail as
a basis of jurisdiction in so far as it goes beyond a statement of the plaintiff’s cause of
action and anticipates or replies to a probable defense.
(internal citations & quotations omitted).
Original federal subject matter jurisdiction is simply lacking here. As made clear by the Second
Circuit, this Court’s analysis under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), applicable to agreements
governed by The Inter-American Convention on International Commercial Arbitration (the “Panama
Convention”),9 Jan. 30, 1975, S. Treaty Doc. 97-12, O.A.S.T.S. No. 42, 14 I.L.M. 336,10 does not vest
this Court with original subject matter jurisdiction. Scandinavian Reinsurance Co. Ltd. v. Saint Paul Fire
and Marine Ins. Co., 668 F.3d 60, 71 (2d Cir. 2012) (“The FAA does not ‘independently confer
subject matter jurisdiction on the federal courts’”) (quoting Durant, Nichols, Houston, Hodgson &
Elsewhere in the Complaint, Plaintiffs deride these claims as “an outlandish conspiracy theory” and subject to dismissal
under Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 if they were pled in federal court. Curiously, if the RICO claims were as facially deficient as
Plaintiffs assert – which they are not – then a federal court could disregard them as a basis for satisfying itself of subject
matter jurisdiction in an action in which they were asserted. For purposes of this action, however, the existence of RICO
counterclaims asserted only in the ICC arbitration is wholly irrelevant to determining the existence of federal subject matter
jurisdiction, or any other question presented by the Complaint.
9 See 9 U.S.C. § 202 (providing that commercial arbitrations, unless solely between citizens of the United States respecting
U.S. interests, “fall under the [New York] Convention”). The Panama Convention applies here because the majority
parties in arbitration are citizens of countries that are signatories to the Panama Convention (Panama and the United
States).
10 While the New York Convention may otherwise apply by its terms to this arbitration agreement, pursuant to the First
Reservation of the United States in its ratification of the Panama Convention, the Panama Convention applies. 9 U.S.C.
§ 305.
8

13

Case 1:18-cv-00390-ER Document 25 Filed 02/20/18 Page 20 of 31

Cortese-Costa, P.C. v. Dupont, 565 F.3d 56, 63 (2d. Cir. 2009)). While original federal subject matter
jurisdiction would exist under the Panama Convention if this were an action to confirm or vacate an
award in an arbitration governed by the Panama Convention by virtue of 9 U.S.C. § 203 (applicable
to agreements covered by the Panama Convention by virtue of 9 U.S.C. § 302), the Panama
Convention does not permit actions to enjoin arbitrations and, as such, there is no original federal
subject matter jurisdiction over this action.11
Federal subject matter jurisdiction does not lie in this Court. Should the Court disagree,
however, Plaintiffs’ Motion should nonetheless be denied on its merits.
II.

The Complaint Fails to State a Claim upon Which Relief May Be Granted
The Complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin a pending international

commercial arbitration under the auspices of the Panama Convention. However, the Panama
Convention provides for no such relief, and the Complaint and Motion on their face invoke no
authority to the contrary. Because the Complaint asserts causes of action that are non-cognizable and
for which relief may not be granted consistent with the Panama Convention, it must be dismissed for
failure to state claim upon which relief may granted pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Ghassabian v.
Hematian, No. 08 Civ. 4400 (SAS), 2008 WL 3982885, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 27, 2008).
Like its counterpart, i.e., the New York Convention, relief under the Panama Convention is
limited to this Court’s recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards; provisions of Chapter 1 of the
FAA (applicable to domestic arbitrations) may apply to Panama Convention arbitrations only “to the
extent Chapter 1 is not in conflict with this chapter or the [Panama Convention] as ratified by the
United States.” 9 U.S.C. § 307. In the implementing statute for the New York and Panama
Conventions, “[p]ower is expressly conferred on the federal courts to compel arbitration, to
appoint arbitrators, or to confirm an arbitration award.” Ghassabian, 2008 WL 3982885, at *2
(emphasis added).
As recognized by Judge Scheindlin in Ghassabian, which concerned an arbitration under the
The structure of the Panama Convention mirrors its enabling statute, codified as Chapter 3 of the FAA, respectively.
See 9 U.S.C § 206, 302 (empowering Courts to compel arbitration); 9 U.S.C. § 207, 302 (empowering courts to confirm
arbitral award, and referring to applicable convention for the grounds for refusing to do so).

11

14

Case 1:18-cv-00390-ER Document 25 Filed 02/20/18 Page 21 of 31

New York Convention (analytically identical for these purposes):
Given this enumerated list of judicial powers, according to the canon of statutory
interpretation expression unius est exclusion alterius (‘the express mention of one thing
excludes all others’) it is unreasonable to infer the existence of further remedies
[beyond those explicitly provided in Chapter 2 of the FAA]. . .Thus neither the New
York Convention nor federal law implementing it creates a cause of action allowing a
party to stay arbitration.
Id. 12 Because of the clear interpretation of applicable federal law implementing the New York
Convention, the Complaint in Ghassabian was dismissed with prejudice for failure to state a claim. The
same result obtains here: Plaintiffs’ Complaint seeking to enjoin an arbitration under the Panama
Convention must be dismissed for failure to state a claim.
III.

A Preliminary Injunction Is Not Warranted Here
Should the Court ultimately conclude that it may entertain Plaintiffs’ Motion on the merits, it

should deny it as Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate the clear and substantial likelihood of success on the
merits, especially where, as here, Plaintiffs ask this Court to disturb the status quo, not to maintain it.
Additionally, Plaintiffs’ significant six week delay in bringing this motion demonstrates the lack of
harm – let alone irreparable harm – to Plaintiffs from participating in the arbitration, as their interests
(and, indeed, liability) are already squarely before the ICC as it concerns claims against Hotel TOC,
Inc., over which Plaintiffs maintain control, are the majority owners and over which ICC jurisdiction
is not contested. Finally, public interests strongly favor arbitration and weigh heavily against plaintiffs’
forum shopping.
A. Plaintiffs Cannot Demonstrate a Clear and Substantial Likelihood of Success
At the outset, the FAA evinces a strong federal policy favoring arbitration. See Moses H. Cone
Mem’l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24 (1983). Well-settled New York law binds a person
or entity to an arbitration agreement, notwithstanding the absence of a signature thereto (a “non-

Any decisions contrary to Ghassabian fail to recognize this critical distinction with respect to the Court’s powers as it
concerns arbitrations. With respect to arbitrations covered by the New York and Panama Conventions, the Court is
exercising legal authority derived from the statutes enacted by Congress to enable each of those Conventions, which do
not include an anti-arbitration injunctions. Had Congress intended to give federal courts the authority to enjoin New
York and Panama Convention arbitrations, it could have done so but did not. Indeed, Congress can authorize specific
forms of relief in federal courts, as it did with the Declaratory Judgment Act, codified at 28 U.S.C. § 2201 et seq.
12

15

Case 1:18-cv-00390-ER Document 25 Filed 02/20/18 Page 22 of 31

signatory”). Indeed, as noted by the Second Circuit, “[i]t does not follow [that] . . . an obligation to
arbitrate attaches only to one who has personally signed the written arbitration provision.” Fisser v.
International Bank, 282 F.2d 231, 233 (2d Cir. 1960). As articulated by the Second Circuit in ThomsonCSF, S.A. v. American Arbitration Ass’n, New York law recognized over 23 years ago, in 1995, at least
five “traditional bases” of contract and agency that can bind a non-signatory to an agreement to
arbitrate: “(1) incorporation by reference; (2) assumption; (3) agency; (4) veil piercing/alter ego; and
(5) estoppel.” 64 F.3d 773, 776-778 (2d Cir. 1995).
1. Plaintiffs Ithaca I and Ithaca II are Bound to Arbitrate Because the HMA is
Expressly Incorporated by Reference in the Bulk Sale Consent Agreement
A party, despite not signing the original agreement to arbitrate, may nonetheless bind itself to
arbitrate a dispute by executing an agreement that expressly incorporates the agreement to arbitrate.
Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. v. C.A. Reaseguradora Nacional de Venezuela, 991 F.2d 42, 46 (2d Cir. 1993);
Pagaduan v. Carnival Corp., No. 16-465, 2017 WL 4117339, at *2-3 (2d Cir. Sept. 18, 2018) (affirming
an order compelling an individual to arbitrate where such individual signed an agreement that “does
not contain an arbitration agreement on its face. It does, however, reference secondary documents
that . . . do call for arbitration”); Clarendon Nat’l Ins. Co., 152 F. Supp. 2d at 520 (holding nonsignatory
bound by arbitration where the guaranty, entered into between signatory and non-signatory to
agreement to arbitrate, expressly incorporated the arbitration agreement); Fidelity & Guar. Ins. Co. v.
W. Point Realty, Inc., No. 02 Civ. 1951 (LMM), 2002 WL 1933780 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2002).
As a threshold matter – one not addressed by the Plaintiffs – the arbitration agreement in the
HMA is sufficiently broad “to allow nonsignatories’ disputes to be brought within its terms.” Limonium
Maritime S.A. v. Mizushima Marinera, S.A., No. 96 Civ. 1888 DC, 1999 WL 46721, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb.
1, 1999), aff’d, 201 F.3d 431 (2d Cir. 1999); see also Progressive Cas. Ins., 991 F.2d at 48-9; Clarendon, 152
F. Supp. 2d at 520. As discussed herein, Ithaca I and Ithaca II are bound to arbitrate because each is
party to an agreement whereby it explicitly agreed to be bound by the HMA, which contains a broad
agreement to arbitrate.
Ithaca II, as purchaser of the Hotel Amenities Units, is bound to arbitrate before the ICC

16

Case 1:18-cv-00390-ER Document 25 Filed 02/20/18 Page 23 of 31

because it expressly agreed to be bound by the HMA, which was incorporated by reference in the
Bulk Sale Consent Agreement. The Bulk Sale Consent Agreement provides, in relevant part, that
“Ithaca II shall be bound by the terms and conditions of the Hotel Management Agreement as
successor to the Hotel Amenities Unit Owner [Newland].” Ex. 2, § 3(A); Ex. 6, HAULA, § 16(i); Ex.
7, Assignment & Assumption Agreement; Ex. 16. The HMA, in Section 9.1, provides for binding
arbitration before the ICC concerning “all disputes, controversies, claims or disagreements arising out
of or relating to [the HMA].” Ex. 1, § 9.1. Plaintiffs, by and through ICC Claimant Hotel TOC, Inc.,
caused the ICC arbitration to be commenced under the HMA against Defendants. Thus, it is clear
that Ithaca II is bound to arbitrate in the proceedings.
Likewise, Ithaca I is bound to arbitrate before the ICC because in purchasing Hotel Units, it
expressly subjected itself to the Co-Ownership Regulations, as well as executed Hotel Unit Rental
Management and Hotel Unit Maintenance Agreements, each containing substantively identical
arbitration provisions, compelling arbitration of all disputes relating to such agreements before the
ICC. Ex. 4, HURMA, § 8.21; Ex. 5, HUMA, § 19(j); License Agreement, § 20(a); see also Ex. 1, Bulk
Sale Consent Agreement at Recitals A – D, ¶¶ 1-3. As described supra, these coordinated agreements,
all set forth in the Bulk Sale Consent Agreement, provide for binding arbitration before the ICC
concerning any and all issues relating to the management of Hotel, which unquestionably concerns
the Notice of Default and Demand for Arbitration which Plaintiffs caused Hotel TOC, Inc.to
commence against Defendants on October 14, 2017.
Finally, both Ithaca I and Ithaca II, pursuant to the Bulk Sale Consent Agreement, explicitly
covenanted to take no actions adverse to the interests of Defendants under and in respect of any of
the “Hotel Agreements,” which expressly identifies and includes the HMA. Ex. 2, § 3(D). Again,
Plaintiffs’ covenants are an express recognition of the interrelated and codependent nature of the
Hotel-related agreements governing the management of the Hotel, which uniformly provide for
binding arbitration before the ICC. When Plaintiffs covenanted to take no action adverse to
Defendants under those Hotel-related agreements, they bound themselves to the HMA, including its
agreement to arbitrate; where Plaintiffs, through their tortious actions, caused injuries to Defendants’
17

Case 1:18-cv-00390-ER Document 25 Filed 02/20/18 Page 24 of 31

rights under the HMA, as Defendants’ Answer, Counterclaims and Request for Joinder lays bare,
Plaintiffs cannot be heard to complain of surprise that they are bound by the HMA, which was
expressly incorporated by reference in the Bulk Sale Consent Agreement.
2. All Plaintiffs are Estopped from Avoiding Arbitration, including Fintiklis
A party is estopped from denying its obligation to arbitrate a dispute when it has received a
direct benefit from the contract containing the arbitration clause. American Bureau of Shipping v. Tencara
Shipyard S.P.A., 170 F.3d 349 (2d Cir. 1999); Life Techs. Corp. v. AB Sciex Pte. Ltd., 803 F. Supp. 2d 270
(S.D.N.Y. 2011). Here, each and every Plaintiff is estopped from avoiding arbitration, as they have
each received (and continue to receive) direct benefits from the HMA and the scheme of Hotel-related
agreements by virtue of their purported control of Hotel TOC, Inc., which is unquestionably bound
to arbitrate pursuant to the HMA.
Fintiklis is the president of Ithaca I and Ithaca II, which together control the majority of the
beneficial interests in both 1) Hotel TOC, Inc., Claimant in the arbitration before the ICC, and 2) its
sole shareholder, Hotel TOC, Foundation. As expressly alleged in Defendants’ Responsive Pleadings
in the ICC, Plaintiffs, through their tortious actions, have usurped unlawful control to cause both
Hotel TOC Foundation and, Hotel TOC, Inc. to declare a breach of the HMA, and commence an
arbitration on behalf of Hotel TOC Inc., in the ICC, all on the same day. See Compl. ¶¶ 29-30. While
Defendants strenuously contest that Plaintiffs lawfully control Hotel TOC Inc. – an issue that will be
litigated before the ICC – the actions that Plaintiffs took to cause Hotel TOC, Inc. to commence a
sham arbitration against Defendants estop Plaintiffs from avoiding arbitration themselves. In short,
Plaintiffs have obtained a direct benefit under the HMA by causing Hotel TOC, Inc. to commence
the arbitration thereunder.
Indeed, the Fourth Circuit, relying on the Second Circuit’s decision in Thomson-CSF,
recognized that non-signatory shareholders may be bound by a corporation’s agreement to arbitrate,
where the shareholders control the activities of the corporation. Long v. Silver, 248 F.3d 309, 319-321
(4th Cir. 2001) (“[W]e see little difference between a parent and its subsidiary and a corporation

18

Case 1:18-cv-00390-ER Document 25 Filed 02/20/18 Page 25 of 31

and its shareholders, where, as here, the shareholders . . . control all of the activities of the
corporation”) (citing Thomson-CSF, 64 F.3d at 776); see also Benefits in a Card, LLC v. Talx Corp., No.
6:06-CV-03655-GRA, 2007 WL 750638 (D.S.C. Mar. 7, 2007). Where the Plaintiffs here have
expressly pleaded that shareholder control in their Complaint in this action and that Plaintiffs
voted to commence the arbitration against the Defendants under the HMA, Plaintiffs are thus
estopped from avoiding the broad arbitration clause which they invoked. See Compl. ¶¶ 5, 2830.
Similarly, Fintiklis is equally estopped from denying the arbitration clause under the HMA
from which he has benefitted. He is the sole person to have acted on behalf on Ithaca I and Ithaca II,
which he controlled and through which he caused his purported appointment to positions of authority
with Hotel TOC Foundation and Hotel TOC, Inc.; Fintiklis then caused Hotel TOC to commence
the arbitration against Defendants, represented by Mr. Fintiklis’ Panamanian and U.S. counsel, all on
October 14, 2017. These facts give rise to no conclusion other than Mr. Fintiklis’ complete control
and domination over the events leading up to the events of October 14, 2017, including the
commencement of arbitration. See Deloitte Noraudit A/S v. Deloitte Hasks & Sells, U.S., 9 F.3d 1060,
1064 (2d Cir. 1993) (compelling arbitration against a non-signatory to an agreement to arbitrate under
estoppel doctrine because such non-signatory knowingly and directly benefitted from the agreement
providing for arbitration); Servaas Inc. v. Republic of Iraq, 686 F. Supp. 2d 346, 355 (S.D.N.Y. 2010)
(“Where a party derived a direct benefit from the contract containing an arbitration provision, . . . it
will be estopped from ‘raising any question of being a nonsignatory to the agreement.’” (citation and
quotations omitted); Alfa Laval U.S. Treasury Inc. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Penn., 857
F. Supp. 2d 404, 415 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (“[T]he non-signatory plaintiffs have received a direct benefit
from the Indemnity Agreements and are estopped from denying their obligation to arbitrate as the
Agreements require.”); HD Brous & Co. v. Mrzyglocki, No. 03 Civ. 8385 (CSH), 2004 WL 376555, at *9
(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 26, 2004).

3. In Addition To Estoppel Doctrine, Fintiklis Is Bound To The HMA Because
He Dominates And Controls Ithaca I, Ithaca II And Hotel TOC Inc.
Fintiklis is further bound to arbitrate before the ICC for the independent reason that he
completely dominates and controls the activities of Ithaca I and Ithaca II which caused Hotel TOC,
Inc. to initiate the arbitration. Likewise, as a result of the October 14, 2017 “luncheon,” Fintiklis now
purports to act for Hotel TOC, Inc. and, through his individual actions, Hotel TOC, Inc. commenced
the arbitration before the ICC. A court can compel arbitration and allow veil piercing where “(1) the
owner exercises complete domination over the corporation with respect to the transaction at issue,
and (2) such domination was used to commit or fraud or wrong that injured the party seeking to piece
the veil.” MAG Portfolio Consultant GMBH v. Merlin Biomed Grp., LLC, 268 F.3d 58, 63 (2d Cir. 2001)
(citation and quotations omitted).
Fintiklis caused Ithaca I and Ithaca II to be incorporated in Panama for the sole purpose of
acquiring unlawful control over the Hotel. At all points relevant to the purchase by Ithaca I and Ithaca
II of 215 units, only one individual was involved – Fintiklis. The notice address on the Bulk Sale
Consent Agreement for Ithaca I and Ithaca II was Fintiklis’ address. Ex. 2, § 6(A). Fintiklis called the
October 14, 2017 “luncheon” meeting of Hotel TOC Foundation. When Ithaca I and Ithaca II
purportedly voted their units to replace members of the Hotel TOC Foundation Council, they
appointed Fintiklis on that same day, October 14, 2017. Fintiklis was then immediately assumed the
role of the “authorized representative” of Hotel TOC, Inc. on October 14, 2017 in Panama and caused
the at-issue arbitration to be commenced against Defendants under the HMA that same day. The
facts make clear that only one person and one person alone – Fintiklis – had any role or activities with
respect to Ithaca I and Ithaca II. The entities exist at his direction and for his benefit. Complete
domination is manifest. See Accordia Ne., Inc. v. Thesseus Int’l Asset Fund, N.V., 205 F. Supp. 2d 176,
181-2 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (finding similar allegations of domination sufficient to defeat a motion to
dismiss).
4. The Forum and Merger Clauses Are Not Dispositive
Despite these obvious agreements to be bound by the HMA, including its arbitration provision,

20

Case 1:18-cv-00390-ER Document 25 Filed 02/20/18 Page 27 of 31

the Plaintiffs flee the ICC arbitration they caused to be commenced in Panama City. The primary
argument advanced by Plaintiffs rely on the forum selection and merger clauses in the Bulk Sale
Consent Agreement. Such clauses are not dispositive of the question of whether Plaintiffs are bound
to arbitrate pursuant to the HMA. See Mot. at 13-18. As a threshold matter, Plaintiffs’ entire argument
concerning the primacy of the forum selection clause in the Bulk Sale Consent Agreement rests on its
false assertion that purportedly all of Defendants’ claims in arbitration “are premised entirely on the
rights and obligations of the parties under the Bulk Sale [Consent] Agreement.” Mot. at 13. That is
false. Under the HMA and Rules of the ICC, which are clearly incorporated by the HMA, what claims
are or are not arbitrable under the HMA is a question of arbitrarily for the ICC, not for this Court.
See First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 943 (1995).
Plaintiffs’ argument that subsequent agreements with exclusive forum selection clauses may
modify prior agreements to arbitrate is inapposite here. Reliance by Plaintiff on Applied Energetics and
Golden Empire is inapposite because, inter alia, Ithaca I and Ithaca II bound themselves to the HMA
and the Bulk Sale Consent Agreement at the same time, when Plaintiffs executed the Bulk Sale Consent
Agreement. Plaintiffs’ assertion that “there is no dispute that the HMA preceded the Bulk Sale
[Consent] Agreement” is plainly misleading as it concerns Plaintiffs’ argument. Mot. at 17.
Moreover, the authority cited by Plaintiffs does not support their argument because even
assuming, arguendo, that Plaintiffs were bound to the Bulk Sale Consent Agreement subsequent to the
HMA (which they were not), the Bulk Sale Consent Agreement does not expressly preclude, prohibit
or otherwise vitiate the HMA arbitration provision.
Goldman Sachs & Co. v. Golden Empire Schools Financing Authority, 922 F. Supp. 2d 435 (S.D.N.Y.
2013), aff’d, 764 F.3d 210 (2d Cir. 2014), relied upon by Plaintiffs concerned a case about whether
parties – an issuer and underwriter of auction rate securities – were bound to arbitrate pursuant to
FINRA Rule § 12200, or whether the terms of their broker-dealer agreement, which provided for all
actions to be brought in the Southern District of New York, governed. First, unlike the broad
mandatory arbitration agreement concerning any and all disputes found in the HMA and as referenced
in the Bulk Sale Consent Agreement, FINRA Rule § 12200 is a permissive arbitration rule whereby a
21

Case 1:18-cv-00390-ER Document 25 Filed 02/20/18 Page 28 of 31

FINRA member is bound to arbitrate a dispute only if requested to do so by a customer. Second,
FINRA Rule § 12200 it is not a prior – or even concurrent – agreement among the same parties; and
third, the merger clause at issue in Golden Empire, which the Second Circuit found to bar arbitration
under a related underwriting agreement, concerned a set of agreements among identical parties. By
contrast, the facts before this Court show that several parties that did not sign the Bulk Sale Consent
Agreement are parties to the HMA, such as Hotel TOC, Inc., Owner’s Meeting and Newland
International Properties, Corp.; this fact, omitted by Plaintiffs undercuts their argument that the Bulk
Sale Consent Agreement was meant to modify or otherwise limit the HMA through the merger clause.
Additionally, Plaintiffs’ reliance on Applied Energetics, Inc. v. NewOak Capital Mkts., LLC is
misplaced. There, the Second Circuit evaluated a merger clause in an agreement that “constitute[d]
the entire understanding and agreement between the parties,” and where the agreement to arbitrate
was contained in an engagement agreement that “also specifically contemplated that the parties would
enter into a subsequent, more formal agreement setting forth ‘the terms and conditions [in the
Engagement Agreement] as well as those customarily contained in agreements of such character.’”
645 F.3d at 523. By contrast, the merger clause in the Bulk Sale Consent Agreement is qualified,
expressly limited to “the matters set forth herein” and seeks to merge any prior agreements “among
the Parties.”
The merger clause in the Bulk Sale Consent Agreement does not and cannot include the HMA
because the HMA is itself an agreement among several parties not involved in the Bulk Sale Consent
Agreement. Ex. 2, § 12 (emphasis added). Furthermore, Plaintiff’s strained reliance on Applied
Energetics further fails because the HMA, unlike the engagement letter in Applied Energetics, is not a
preliminary agreement and does not contemplate a later agreement necessary to formalize it: To the
contrary, the HMA is part and parcel of a host of inter-related Hotel Agreements, all of which were
expressly incorporated by reference in the Bulk Sale Consent Agreement and attached thereto s
exhibits.
Furthermore Bank Julius Baer & Co. v. Waxfield Ltd. is a case Plaintiffs noted as having been
cited in Golden Empire (Mot. at 16) but which is conspicuously avoided by Plaintiffs. In that case, the
22

Case 1:18-cv-00390-ER Document 25 Filed 02/20/18 Page 29 of 31

Second Circuit addresses an agreement containing a forum selection clause but which makes no
mention of arbitration as set forth in related agreements. In Bank Julius Baer, the Second Circuit held
that it could not “say that the . . . [c]lause, which does not even mention arbitration, either ‘specifically
precludes’ arbitration or contains a ‘positive assurance’ that this dispute is not governed by the
arbitration agreement.” 424 F.3d 278, 284 (2d Cir. 2005).
Moreover, the merger clause in Bank Julius, similar to the merger clause in the Bulk Sale
Consent Agreement, was qualified. Id. Likewise, as was the case with the agreement in Bank Julius,
the Bulk Sale Consent Agreement makes no mention of arbitration. In fact, the Bulk Sale Consent
Agreement elsewhere expressly subjects Ithaca I and Ithaca II to the very HMA which contains an
agreement to arbitrate. Plaintiffs cannot with a straight face argue that these facts constitute positive
assurance against arbitration or specific preclusion thereof.
Plaintiffs’ argument that the HMA has somehow been restated and/or “subsumed” into the
Bulk Sale Consent Agreement is baseless. The face of the Bulk Sale Consent Agreement establishes
that Ithaca I and Ithaca II agree to be bound to the HMA. See supra at 14-5; Ex. 2, §§ 3(A), (D). There
is no indication – express or implied – that the Bulk Sale Consent Agreement modified or “subsumed”
the HMA or any other Hotel Agreement identified in the Bulk Sale Consent Agreement. First, the
two agreements concern discrete and distinct subject matters: the HMA concerns Defendants’
management of the Hotel and their rights thereunder; in contrast, the Bulk Sale Consent Agreement
while expressly incorporating by reference the HMA, concerns the terms and conditions pursuant to
which Plaintiffs Ithaca I and Ithaca II were obtaining Defendants’ consent to purchase Hotel Units,
which Plaintiffs otherwise would have been unable to purchase. Second, the HMA and Bulk Sale
Consent Agreement are by and among distinct parties – Hotel TOC Inc., Newland International
Properties Corp. and Owners Meeting of P.H. TOC are also parties to the HMA, but not parties to
the Bulk Sale Consent Agreement.13 Third, accepting Plaintiffs’ arguments would undermine, if not
vitiate, the entire scheme on which the Defendants’ management rights of the Hotel are founded,
13 The HMA was amended and restated on or about April 13, 2011 and further amended on July 3, 2013. The form of
such amendment were a writing, signed by all parties to the agreement. The Bulk Sale Consent Agreement falls far short
of amending any terms of the HMA.

23

Case 1:18-cv-00390-ER Document 25 Filed 02/20/18 Page 30 of 31

despite that all relevant Hotel-related agreements are expressly referenced and incorporated by the
Bulk Sale Consent Agreement and include identical ICC dispute resolution provisions.
Finally, Plaintiffs advance another meaningless argument: that the HMA, “to the extent it is
incorporated into the Bulk Sale [Consent] Agreement, is derivative of, not superior to, the rights of
Plaintiffs and [Defendants] under the Bulk Sale [Consent] Agreement.” Mot. at 17. This argument is
nonsensical. The Bulk Sale Consent Agreement is clear on its face: the HMA, as a “Hotel Agreement,”
is explicitly incorporated by reference in the Bulk Sale Consent Agreement and the parties expressly
bind themselves thereto. Plaintiffs’ derivative/superior argument is an improper invitation to the
Court to attempt to categorize Defendants’ arbitration claims into those that are governed by the
HMA and those that are governed by the Bulk Sale Consent Agreement, an invitation which this Court
must decline. Even assuming this Court were not to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, or
for failure to assert a cognizable claim under which relief may be granted under the Panama
Convention, once this Court finds that the Plaintiffs are bound to the HMA, all other questions of
arbitrability must be resolved by the ICC, as the HMA evidences a clear intent to refer all “questions
of arbitrability” to the ICC. Shaw Grp. Inc. v. Triplefine Int’l Corp., 322 F.3d 115, 124-25 (2d Cir. 2003)
(vacating district court’s order enjoining arbitration “because the parties’ arbitration agreement is
broadly worded to require the submission of ‘all disputes’ concerning the [contract] to arbitration, and
because it provides for arbitration to be conducted under the rules of the ICC, which assign the
arbitrator initial responsibility to determine issues of arbitrability”); Gilman v. Waters, 61 F. Supp. 3d
794, 801 (S.D. Ind. 2014) (finding incorporation of AAA arbitration rules into arbitration agreement
clear and unmistakable delegation of authority, relying on Second Circuit precedent); Paine Webber Inc.
v. Bybyk, 81 F.3d 1193, 1202 (2d Cir. 1996).
B. Plaintiffs’ Delay is Fatal And Public Interests Favor Arbitration
Finally, Plaintiffs delayed from December 4, 2017 until January 18, 2018 to serve and file the
instant action. Plaintiffs’ delay should bar Plaintiff’s request for a preliminary injunction as such delay
undermines any assertion of irreparable immediate harm. See Tom Doherty Assocs., Inc., 60 F.3d at 39

24

Case 1:18-cv-00390-ER Document 25 Filed 02/20/18 Page 31 of 31

(“A district court should generally consider delay in assessing irreparable harm”); Local No. 503 of
Graphic Commc’ns Conference of Int’l Bhd. Of Teamsters v. Cascades Containerboard Packading-Lancaster, No.
17-CV-6605 (MAT), 2017 WL 6497624, at *3 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 19, 2017) (finding, in dicta, that an
unexplained, two-month delay in seeking a preliminary injunction made it “unlikely that, even if the
Court were to reach this issue, it could conclude that plaintiff had established its likelihood of suffering
irreparable harm”)
As noted by the Second Circuit, “it is difficult to overstate the strong federal policy in favor
of arbitration.” Arcinaga v. Gen. Motors Corp., 460 F.3d 231, 234 (2d Cir. 2006). That policy is likewise
reflected in the Panama Convention, which was ratified by the United States. The Panama Convention
does not empower this Court to enjoin an international arbitration. Those important public policies
strongly disfavor Plaintiffs’ forum shopping here. In addition, this Court should consider principles
of International Comity applicable here. If Plaintiffs – all foreigners with substantial ties to Panama
and, in the case of Ithaca I and Ithaca II, no ties to the United States – had brought these claims in
Panama, they would have been referred to arbitration immediately, as Panama recognizes and enforces
competence-competence pursuant to its Constitution. See Political Constitution of the Republic of Panama,
Article 202. For the foregoing reasons, this action should be dismissed with prejudice. In the event
the Court reaches the merits of Plaintiffs’ Motion, it should be denied in its entirety.
