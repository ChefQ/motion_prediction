PLAINTIFFS' MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS'
MOTION TO STAY ALL PROCEEDINGS

Plaintiffs, Charles Ray Sims and Pamela Sims, on behalf of themselves and others
similarly situated, by and through their counsel of record, hereby respectfully submit this
Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' motion to stay all proceedings.

I. INTRODUCTION

On March 21, 2007, Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all other similarly

situated residents of Arkansas, filed the instant action in this Court. On April 12, 2007, the

Defendants avoided answering the Complaint by filing a Motion to Stay all proceedings.

-l-
Case 5:07-cv-05053-JLH Document10_ Filed 04/18/2007 Page 2of 10

Il. ARGUMENT

In support of its Motion to Stay, Defendants argue, among other things, that a stay is
necessary to "avoid undue prejudice to the parties;" to avoid inconsistent class
determinations;" and "that Judge Waters noted that judicial economy would be best served
if litigation was facilitated in the appropriate forum."

As fully discussed herein, these arguments lack merit.

A. Delaying the Ruling on Motions to Remand Pending Action

by the J.P.M.L. on Motions to Transfer and Consolidate Is
Unwarranted.

lt has been established by both the J.P.M.L. and multiple district courts, motions to
Stay are generally denied when motions to transfer and consolidate are concurrently
pending. The Defendants' mention of Judge Waters's opinion is misleading in that Judge
Waters stayed a proceeding based upon his entry of the conditional order to transfer to an
existing MDL. Kohl v. American Home Prods. Corp., 78 F.Supp 2d 885 (W.D. Ark. 1999).
In fact, the Eighth Circuit recognizes that a motion to transfer does not automatically stay
discovery.

The Court has addressed this same issue in two unpublished opinions. See

Baker v. Wyeth-Ayerst Labs. Div., et al., Civil No. 98-5126 (Aug. 6 1998) and

Brightwell v. A.H.Robins Co., Inc., et al., Civil No. 99-5061 (June 2, 1999). In

those cases, this court recognized that a motion to transfer a case to

MDL does not automatically stay discovery, postpone rulings on

pending motions, or generally suspend further proceedings in the court

in which the action was filed. See Rule 1.5 of the Rules of Procedure of

the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. See also Tortola Restaurants,

L.P. v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 987 F.Supp. 1186, 1188-89 (N.D.Cal. 1997).
See Kohl v. American Home Products Corp., et al., 78 F.Supp.2d 885 (emphasis added).

In the case at hand, Plaintiffs seek an answer to their complaint and to initiate preliminary
Case 5:07-cv-05053-JLH Document10_ Filed 04/18/2007 Page 3of 10

discovery. This court will not be required to familiarize itself with the intricacies of the case
at this early date, and the judicial resources extended to require the Defendants to Answer
the Complaint and begin discovery would be minimal. Additionally, the Defendants would
not be prejudiced by answering Plaintiffs' straight-forward product liability Complaint, and
Plaintiffs' counsel is willing to accept discovery responses on a computer disc and share
discovery with other Plaintiff's counsel. This will eliminate any potential hardship on the
defense. If Defendants are allowed a stay, the Plaintiffs will be prejudiced by having to wait
months to learn what defenses it will face. The Plaintiffs will not know if there are
objections to various issues, i.e., subject matter jurisdiction, insufficiency of process,
insufficiency of service of process and other defenses. The Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure provide the defense twenty days to answer a complaint, not months, which is in
effect what the defense has asked this Court to allow. Further, there is no assurance that
the case will be transferred to another court, and there is no reason to prejudice the
Plaintiffs' claim based upon a speculative transfer.

B. With Limited Exception, District Courts Should Not Stay
Proceedings During the Pendency of a Motion for
Consolidation Before the J.P.M.L.

Inthe absence of extraordinary circumstances, both the Rules of the Judicial Panel
on Multidistrict Litigation and the overwhelming case law urge district courts to deny
requests for stays during the pendency of motions for transfer and consolidation before the
J.P.MLL.

The Rules of the J.P.M.L. unequivocally provide that, during the pendency of a
motion for consideration before the J.P.M.L., the case should be allowed to proceed:

The pendency ofa motion, order to show cause, conditional transfer order or

-3-
Case 5:07-cv-05053-JLH Document10_ Filed 04/18/2007 Page 4of 10

conditional remand order before the Panel concerning transfer or remand of

an action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1407 does not affect or suspend orders

and pretrial proceedings in the district court in which the action is pending

and does not in any way limit the pretrial jurisdiction of that court.

Rule 1.5 of the Rules of the J.P.M.L. (emphasis added). See a/so, Manual for Complex
Litigation (3rd) 0x00A7 31.131; 17 Moore's Federal Practice 0x00A7 112.06[1] ("the pendency of
transfer order does not limit the power of the transferor court to act on matters properly
before it... .").

Indeed, well-established case law fully supports the principle that a case should
proceed during the pendency of a motion to consolidate. Villarreal v. Chrysler Corp., 1996
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3159, 1996 WL 116832 (Cal. 1996); Carol Cable Company, Inc. v. Koffler,
1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8434 (MDL No. 797) (E.D. Pa. 1989) (district court denied
Defendants' motion to stay discovery prior to MDL Panel's ruling on motion to transfer and
consolidate); In re Airport Car Rental Antitrust Litig., 448 F.Supp. 273, 275 (J.P.M.L. 1978)
(pendency of section 1407 proceedings should not delay progress of case); In re Air Crash
Disaster at Paris, France, on March 3, 1974, 376 F.Supp. 887 (J.P.M.L. 1973) ("We have
previously noted that the mere pendency of a motion before the Panel does not affect or
suspend orders and discovery proceedings in the transferor district court. . . ."); Inre Four
Seasons Securities Litigation, 362 F.Supp. 574, 575 n.2 (J.P.M.L. 1973) (same); In re
Penn Central Securities, 333 F.Supp. 382, 384 n.4 (J.P.M.L. 1971); In re Master Key
Antitrust Litig. 320 F.Supp. 1404 (J.P.M.L. 1971) (court shouid proceed with case). See
also In re Swine Flu Immunization Products Liability Litig., 89 F.R.D. 695 (D.C. 1981)

(substantial discovery conducted prior to MDL consolidation); EEOC v. Burlington Northern,

Inc., 618 F.Supp. 1046 (D. Ill. 1985) (same).

4.
Case 5:07-cv-05053-JLH Document10_ Filed 04/18/2007 Page 5of 10

Therefore, the pendency of Defendants' motion for transfer and cansolidation before
the J.P.M.L. does not invoke an automatic stay of this case. To the contrary, both case law
and the J.P.M.L. Rules provide that a stay is unwarranted.

Cc. A Stay Subjects Plaintiffs to Substantial, Unnecessary and
Undue Prejudice.

Plaintiffs, who as master of their Complaint, have the right to proceed in the venue
of their choice and would be obligated to spend a substantial amount of time and money
(as well as to retain local counsel in another state), were the J.P.M.L. to send this matter to
another federal district court. If the cases are sent to another district court, Plaintiffs will
have lost the opportunity to prosecute this case during the pendency of the stay.

Defendants have had ample time and opportunity to prepare a responsive answer to
Plaintiffs' Complaint in this Court, as they have been aware of the circumstances
surrounding claims and allegations made by Plaintiffs as set forth in the following Timeline

Clearly the Defendants knew at least as early as February 20, 2007, that its product
was causing kidney failure in pets throughout the country. Armed with the knowledge that
its product, pet food, might be causing pet deaths, Defendants waited one week to initiate
any testing. On approximately, February 27, 2007, Defendants discovered that between
14-25% of the animals tested died after eating the food. On or about the same day,
Defendants' Chief Financial Officer sold half of his stock. About one week later on or about
March 6, 2007, Defendant stopped using a Chinese food supplier. Defendants then waited
until March 15, 2007 to advise the FDA of the Defendants' test results. After consulting
with the FDA, Defendants issued a recall! of 60 million food units including more than 90
brands of cat and dog food. On March 23, 2007, a New York State Laboratory discovered
a form of rat poison unapproved for use in the United States in Defendants' pet food. A
week later on March 30, 2007 the FDA identified melamine in wheat gluten imported from
China that had been used in Defendants' pet food. On this date, March 30, 2007,
Defendants came forward with a press release that all of its food products manufactured
after March 6, 2007, were safe. Less than one week later, Defendants expanded the recall
of their product back to November 8, 2006. It was announced today, April 18, 2007, that
Defendants have expanded their recall yet again to add one additional dog food product to
their recall list and two more production dates of eight varieties of tainted pet food.

The Defendants have been less than forthcoming with the public and the FDA.

 
Case 5:07-cv-05053-JLH Document10_ Filed 04/18/2007 Page 8of 10

Defendants' Chief Financial Officer was selling his stock well before the recall. The
Defendants quit using its Chinese supplier before the State of New York discovered
aminopterin, a rat poison unapproved for use in the United States but allowed in China.
The Defendants discontinued its Chinese supplier three weeks be fore the FDA discovered
melamine in the wheat gluten purchased from China. Defendants are playing a lethal
game with the public, the FDA, and now this Court. As outlined in the timeline above,
Plaintiffs' dog would not have died had Defendants advised the public and the FDA of the
problem when it was determined after their testing on February 27, 2007. Instead,
Defendants' Chief Financial Officer chose to sell off shares of stock. The Defendants will
stall answering questions about its actions as long as the courts will allow them.

The Defendants are not prejudiced by being forced to comply with the law and
answer Plaintiffs' Complaint. Further, they will not be prejudiced from providing basic
information, including corporate structure, animal health complaints, ingredients, supplier
information, test resuits and correspondence. Conversely, the Plaintiffs are prejudiced by
being prevented from obtaining basic facts known by the defense, by having to guess at
potential defenses that will be claimed, and by relying on what is reported in newspapers
and press releases. Again, the Court will not have to expend many resources in requiring
Defendants to comply with the law by answering a complaint and engaging in basic
discovery.

lil. CONCLUSION
Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this

Court deny Defendants' motion for an Order staying all proceedings, and instead Order
Case 5:07-cv-05053-JLH Document10_ Filed 04/18/2007 Page 9Qof 10

Defendants to Answer Plaintiffs' Complaint and proceed with discovery pursuant to the

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
