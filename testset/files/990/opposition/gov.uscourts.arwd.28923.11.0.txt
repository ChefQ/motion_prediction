DEFENDANTS’ REPLY TO PLANTIFFS’ RESPONSE TO
DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO STAY
COMES NOW the Separate Defendants, MENU FOODS INCOME FUND,
MENU FOODS MIDWEST CORPORATION, MENU FOODS SOUTH
DAKOTA, INC., MENU FOODS, INC. and MENU FOODS HOLDINGS, INC.,
(collectively referred to as “MENU FOODS”), by and through counsel, JONES &
HARPER, and submit their reply in support of Defendants’ Motion to Stay pending
the transfer decision by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (“JPML”) and a
determination of class certification by the transferee court.

In support thereof,

Defendants set forth the following:

In their opposition to Defendants Motion to Stay, Plaintiffs contend that
“there is no assurance that the case will be transferred to another court, and there is
no reason to prejudice the Plaintiffs’ claim based upon a speculative transfer.” Yet,
on April 16, 2007, this Plaintiff filed a motion for consolidation and transfer to the
Western District of Arkansas (“Plaintiff Simms’ MDL Motion”). See Plaintiff Simms’
MDL Motion attached hereto as Exhibit “A.” Additionally, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed
another case on April 13, 2007, in the Western District of Arkansas with almost
identical allegations against Defendants to bolster their argument for transfer to the
Western District of Arkansas. See Cooper v. Menu Foods, et. al., attached hereto as
Exhibit “B.” Defendants have yet to be served or appear in the Cooper case. The
fact that Plaintiff filed another case in the Western District of Arkansas with almost
identical allegations against Defendants also weighs heavily in favor of a stay and
makes consolidation appropriate.

Moreover, in Plaintiff Simms’ MDL Motion,

Plaintiffs not only agree with Defendants’ arguments for a stay but use them in their
MDL Motion.

Specifically, Plaintiffs agree that “transfer and consolidation will

promote convenience for the parties and efficiency in the pretrial proceedings by
eliminating duplicative discovery and the potential for inconsistent rulings, including
determinations on class certification;” See Exhibit “A,” pp. 4-5.
Plaintiffs contend that they will eliminate any potential hardship on Defendants
by “accept[ing] discovery responses on a computer disc and shar[ing] discovery with
other Plaintiffs’ counsel.”

Yet, in their MDL Motion, Plaintiffs argue for

consolidation because:
“Plaintiffs in each action will seek to depose many of the
same individuals from the Defendants and their various
affiliates and request production of a substantially similar
set of documents. Failing to consolidate these actions will
therefore result in duplicative discovery efforts, requiring
witnesses to appear for multiple depositions and
defendants to produce several sets of the same
documents.”
See Exhibit “A,” p.7. The idea of this Plaintiffs’ counsel volunteering to manage pretrial discovery amongst all Plaintiffs’ counsel is absurd.

Plaintiffs’ counsel is

attempting to push this case along to bolster his argument for transfer and
consolidation to the Western District of Arkansas.
Plaintiffs contend that they “will be prejudiced by having to wait months to
learn what defenses it will face.” Defendants are not asking this Court to stay the
proceedings indefinitely, but rather until the Judicial Panel hears the MDL Motions
(Collectively known as “MDL 1850 - In re Pet Food Products Liability Litigation.”). The
Judicial Panel has issued a Notice of Hearing Session that it will consider the MDL
Motions on May 31, 2007, approximately five (5) weeks from the filing of this
pleading. See April 12, 2007 Notice of Hearing Session attached hereto as Exhibit
“C.”
Additionally, Plaintiffs contend that “motions to stay are generally denied when
motions to transfer and consolidate are concurrently pending” without citing to a
single opinion by this Court or the Eighth Circuit to support its proposition. To the

contrary, Eighth Circuit courts have granted motions to stay pending a transfer
decision by the Judicial Panel, and for persuasive authority on the issue, Defendants
offer citation to Baron v. Merck & Co., Inc., 2006 WL 2521615, *1 (E.D. Mo. 2006);
S.M. ex rel. Wilson v. Janssen Pharmaceutica, L.P., 2006 WL 950212, *1 (E.D. Mo. 2006);
Buie v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City, Inc. 2005 WL 2218461, *2 (W.D. Mo.
2005); Calder v. A.O. Smith Corp., 2004 WL 1469370, *1 (D. Minn. 2004). On the issue
of stays pending a determination of class certification, Defendants offer the following
citations for persuasive authority: Kramer v. NCS Pearson, Inc., 2003 WL 21640494, *1
(D.Minn. 2003); Johnson v. Resource Bancshares Mortg. Group, 1999 WL 33912054, *2
(D.Minn. 1999); Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. of Olean v. Cargill, Inc., Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.
1995 WL 783610, *5 (D. Minn. 1995).
Further, the cases which Plaintiff cites for the proposition that “a case should
proceed during the pendency of a motion to consolidate” either can be distinguished
or are not relevant to the case at bar. In re Airport Car Rental Antitrust. Litig., 448 F.
Supp. 273 (J.P.M.L. 1978) (Motion to stay was not at issue; court was asked to decide
whether it should consolidate cases to promote judicial efficiency); In re Master Key
Antitrust Litig., 320 F. Supp. 1404 (J.P.M.L. 1971) (same); In re Swine Flu Immunization
Prods. Liab. Litig., 89 F. R. D. 695 (D. D.C. 1981) (Motion to stay was not at issue;
court was asked to determine appropriate attorneys’ fees); EEOC v. Burlington Northern,
Inc., 618 F. Supp. 1046 (N.D. Ill. 1985) (same).

For all of the above and foregoing reasons, Defendants’ Motion to Stay should
be granted. Defendants are not asking this Court to enter a stay to “avoid[] answering
the Complaint,” but rather because a stay would further the interests of judicial
economy and promote just and efficient conduct of this litigation. Furthermore,
absent a stay, Defendants would be substantially prejudiced by duplicative discovery
and expending significant resources defending multiple cases in jurisdictions around
the country.

Conversely, any slight delay that Plaintiffs may experience will be

minimal. Given the high probability of consolidation, and in order to promote the
goals of Section 1407 of avoiding duplicative efforts and inconsistent rulings, this
Court should stay these proceedings pending the transfer decision by the Judicial
Panel and determination on class certification by the transferee court.
WHEREFORE, Separate Defendants, MENU FOODS INCOME FUND,
MENU FOODS MIDWEST CORPORATION, MENU FOODS SOUTH
DAKOTA, INC., MENU FOODS, INC. and MENU FOODS HOLDINGS, INC.,
respectfully request this Honorable Court enter an Order staying further proceedings
in this matter, including but not limited to Separate Defendants’ obligation to timely
respond to Plaintiffs’ Complaint, pending the transfer decision by the Judicial Panel
and a determination of class certification by the transferor court.
Respectfully submitted,
