IN RE:
REEBOK EASYTONE LITIGATION

Case No. 3:12-MC-00001-L (BF)
Hon. Paul D. Stickney
Original Case No. 4:10-CV-11977FDS (D. Mass.)

PLAINTIFFS’ RESPONSE AND BRIEF IN OPPOSITION TO
OBJECTOR NIKKI JOHNSON’S MOTION TO LIMIT DEPOSITION
Plaintiffs Sandra Altieri, Courtney Schwartz, and Cheryl Hardy (“Plaintiffs”) individually
and on behalf of the other members of the certified Settlement Class in In re: Reebok EasyTone
Litigation, Case No. 4:10-CV-11977-FDS (D. Mass.), respond as follows in opposition to
Objector Nikki Johnson’s Motion to Limit Deposition (Dkt. No. 7) (“Motion to Limit”): the
motion has already been decided, is without merit, and is yet is another attempt by Ms. Johnson
and her counsel to delay through a baseless filing.
On January 5, 2012, Objector Nikki Johnson moved to quash Plaintiffs’ subpoena
commanding her attendance at a deposition. After full briefing, this Court denied Ms. Johnson’s
Motion to Quash, found that class counsel is entitled to take Ms. Johnson’s deposition, and
ordered that the deposition shall be taken by February 1, 2012.1 That deposition has yet to occur.

See January 18, 2012 Order (Dkt. No. 6, “Order”). Indeed, Plaintiffs will take Ms. Johnson’s deposition
because doing so will enable Plaintiffs to discover, among the other topics noted in Plaintiffs’ Response
and Brief in Opposition to Objector Nikki Johnson’s Motion to Quash Deposition Subpoena (Dkt. No. 4;
“Response Brief”), the full extent of Ms. Johnson’s (and her counsel’s) history as “serial” or
“professional” objectors who object in class action cases, not for the benefit of the class, but, instead, to
extort payment from settlement proponents.

Plaintiffs have rescheduled Ms. Johnson’s deposition for January 30, 2012, but now Ms.
Johnson seeks to revisit this Court’s Order by requesting spurious limits on the length and scope
of her deposition. Plaintiffs respectfully submit that this Court deny Ms. Johnson’s Motion to
Limit for three reasons.
First, although Ms. Johnson could have done so, she failed to request limitations on the
length or scope of her deposition in her prior Motion to Quash. Ms. Johnson’s dilatory tactic of
attempting to re-litigate issues that have already been decided by the Court is ground enough to
deny her Motion to Limit.
Second, while Plaintiffs fully intend to conduct the deposition of Ms. Johnson as
efficiently and quickly as possible – having scheduled the deposition to begin at 1:00 P.M. and
having further scheduled a return flight to Chicago for that same evening – imposing a time limit
on the deposition – other than the limit provided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure – may
not give counsel sufficient time to discover the full extent of Ms. Johnson’s own history2 and her
knowledge of her counsel’s history3 as a “serial” or “professional” class action objector. Unlike
Lori Rivero – another objector in this case who moved to withdraw her objection after her
motion to quash her deposition was denied by Magistrate Judge Ellington in the Southern
District of Texas, Case No. 2:12-mc-0002 – Ms. Johnson has an individually documented history
as a professional objector, in addition to the professional objector history of her attorney, Mr.

See, e.g., In re Mut. Funds Inv. Litig., No. MDL 1586, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31787, *33 n.1 (D. Md.
Mar. 23, 2011) (“Clifton brings this objection by and through her attorney, Thomas L. Cox, Jr. It appears
that Mr. Cox is a frequent and professional objector, as he has objected or represented objectors in at least
six other class actions since 2010. Mr. Cox’s objections were not sustained in any of these cases.”).
Additional cases in which Ms. Cox represented objectors are listed in footnote 12 of Plaintiffs’ Response
Brief.

Cox. Not only would imposing Movant’s requested time limitation on Ms. Johnson’s deposition
– where there is more to cover than there would have been in Ms. Rivero’s – needlessly
countermand the Federal Rules, but it will also enable Ms. Johnson’s counsel to try to “run out
the clock” on the deposition without Ms. Johnson providing the necessary testimony.4
Although Judge Ellington placed a one-hour time limit on Ms. Rivero’s deposition – who
did not have her own personal history of objecting to class action settlements, as Ms. Johnson
does here – she also invited the parties to contact the Court if “there are shenanigans going on”
and further made clear that she would not “allow the clock to tick” if the parties had to expend
time resolving such shenanigans.5 Judge Ellington also suggested at one point during her ruling
that the deposition take place under judicial supervision.6 While Plaintiffs would be pleased to
conduct the deposition under direct Court supervision, denying Ms. Johnson’s attempt to impose
a time limit beyond that already provided by the Federal Rules may be enough to impress upon
Ms. Johnson’s counsel that shenanigans and clock running are unacceptable without further
involving the Court in what should be routine discovery.

Plaintiffs’ concern is well founded. Ms. Johnson has already declared through her filings in this matter
that “depositions will gain no additional information,” and that “Counsel will learn nothing from a
deposition that he does not already know.” See Motion to Quash Deposition (Dkt. No. 1) at ¶ 7 and Nikki
Johnson’s Reply to Plaintiffs’ Response and Brief in Opposition to Objector Nikki Johnson’s Motion to
Quash Deposition Subpoena (Dkt. No. 5) at p. 7. These declarations will only be true if Ms. Johnson’s
Counsel improperly instructs Ms. Johnson not to answer Plaintiffs’ counsel’s questions. To that end,
Plaintiffs note that “speaking objections” are unnecessary and improper, and that under the Federal Rules,
an attorney may only instruct his or her client not to answer a question in a deposition when there is a
good-faith basis for asserting a valid privilege.

Quash Rivero Deposition at p. 51-53 (Jan. 6, 2012).

Finally, Plaintiffs’ counsel intends to depose Ms. Johnson to determine whether she is
objecting to the Settlement for her and her counsel’s own pecuniary benefit, rather than for the
benefit of the Settlement Class as a whole. Ms. Johnson’s and her counsel’s history strongly
suggest that their motives are improper. Whether Ms. Johnson ever requested or received
payment in any form whatsoever in any prior case to withdraw an objection to a class action
settlement – even in cases where the propriety of her objections are pending on appeal, such as
the NVIDIA GPU Litigation presently pending before the Ninth Circuit – is material and
discoverable in this action. An objector’s request or receipt of payment to withdraw an objection
or an appeal without providing any benefit to a Settlement Class is not privileged or protected
information – rather, it is extortion and a legitimate topic for examination. As Justice Lewis
Brandeis once stated, “sunlight is said to be the best disinfectant”7 and only by shining a light on
professional objectors’ exploitation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e)(5) for their own
personal benefit, instead of for the benefit of classes as a whole, can the judicial system halt this
increasingly problematic practice.
Accordingly, Plaintiffs respectfully submit that this Court deny Objector Nikki Johnson’s
Motion to Limit Deposition.
