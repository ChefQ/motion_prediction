DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS

Case 4:18-cv-00030-HCM-RJK Document 11 Filed 05/24/18 Page 2 of 32 PageID# 70

INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff and Defendant market competing skin substitutes for the treatment of hard-toheal wounds. Defendant recently conducted a highly flawed study that purported to show that its
product, Apligraf®, was more effective than Plaintiff’s product, TheraSkin®. Among the many
problems with the study, the wounds treated with TheraSkin may have been worse than those
treated with Apligraf; Apligraf was applied more frequently than TheraSkin; the study purported
to evaluate how long it took each product to completely close the wounds but actually evaluated
only how long it took the wounds to reach a specified, and arbitrarily selected, size; and the
study didn’t account for other characteristics of the patients (such as other illnesses) that could
skew the results. Notably, the individuals conducting the study were all affiliated with
Defendant, including a current member of Defendant’s Board of Directors, current and former
employees of the Defendant, and Defendant’s paid consultants.
Based on that highly flawed study, Defendant created an advertisement that not only
touted the false conclusions of the study but also added additional false and misleading claims.
Defendant then circulated the advertisement, with a link to the study, to numerous actual and
potential customers, including hospitals, wound care clinics and physicians to encourage them to
purchase and use Apligraf rather than TheraSkin. As a result, Plaintiff has suffered, and
continues to suffer, irreparable harm.
Defendants make much of the fact that the study was published in a peer reviewed
journal. But false and misleading advertising is not immune from the Lanham Act merely
because it references a publication in a peer reviewed journal.
Because Plaintiff has adequately alleged all of the elements of a Lanham Act claim, as
well as all of the elements of a claim for false advertising under the Virginia Code, Defendant’s
motion to dismiss should be denied.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
Plaintiff and Defendant market competing skin substitutes: Apligraf and TheraSkin.
Defendant’s Apligraf Product
Defendant Organogenesis markets a skin substitute called Apligraf, which is used to treat
chronic wounds including diabetic foot ulcers (“DFUs”) and venous leg ulcers (“VLUs”).
Apligraf is made from substances extracted from the tendons of cattle and the foreskins of
human infants.
In order to receive approval from the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to market
Apligraf, Organogenesis submitted an application for premarket approval (“PMA”). The PMA
included data from a 297 patient prospective randomized controlled trial (the “Organogenesis
Pivotal Trial”). This study compared the use of Apligraf and compression to the use of zinc paste
gauze and compression in VLUs of greater than one month duration that had not adequately
responded to conventional therapy.
Based on the results of the study, the FDA approved Apligraf as a medical device in
1998.
Plaintiff’s TheraSkin Product
In 2009, Solsys (which, at the time was called Soluble Systems, LLC) began to market a
competing FDA-regulated skin substitute called TheraSkin. Like Apligraf, TheraSkin is used to
treat chronic wounds including DFUs and VLUs. TheraSkin is made from cryopreserved human
skin. Unlike Apligraf, TheraSkin does not include animal-derived or human cultured cells or
tissues.
Post-market studies of TheraSkin have demonstrated the product’s safety and
effectiveness in treating both DFUs and VLUs. For example, a retrospective clinical study of 188
patients seen at the Inova Wound Center in Mount Vernon, Virginia, found that approximately

-2-

Case 4:18-cv-00030-HCM-RJK Document 11 Filed 05/24/18 Page 4 of 32 PageID# 72

60% of DFU and VLU wounds had closed after 12 weeks of treatment with TheraSkin, and
roughly 75% of VLUs and DFUs had closed after 20 weeks of treatment with TheraSkin. Like
the Organogenesis Pivotal Trial, this TheraSkin study defined wound “closure” as the complete
epithelialization (i.e., complete coverage of the wound with new skin cells, an essential
component of wound healing) of the wound without drainage.
Defendant’s Flawed Retrospective Study
In 2015, Organogenesis funded a retrospective study (the “Organogenesis Retrospective
Study” or the “Study”) that purported to compare the effectiveness of Apligraf and TheraSkin in
the treatment of VLUs. The authors of the study were all affiliated with Organogenesis and
included a current Organogenesis Board member as well as current and former employees of
Organogenesis and paid consultants of Organogenesis.
This study differed in a number of significant ways from the Organogenesis Pivotal Trial.
One of the biggest differences is that the Organogenesis Pivotal Trial was a prospective
randomized clinical trial, in which patients with equivalent wounds were randomly selected to
receive treatment with either Apligraf or zinc paste gauze and the healing of the two groups was
compared over time. In contrast, the Organogenesis Retrospective Study was “retrospective,”
meaning the study used existing data taken from medical records of patients who had been
previously treated with either Apligraf or TheraSkin.
There are numerous problems with the Organogenesis Retrospective Study. First, the
wounds treated with TheraSkin appear to have been worse at the outset of the study than the
wounds treated with Apligraf. The study shows that prior to treatment, the wounds treated with
TheraSkin had been present an average of three months longer than the wounds treated with
Apligraf, suggesting that they were more serious, slower healing wounds. This completely

-3-

Case 4:18-cv-00030-HCM-RJK Document 11 Filed 05/24/18 Page 5 of 32 PageID# 73

undermines the entire study because it suggests that these wounds would have taken longer to
heal regardless of what treatment was used.
Similarly, the Study provided no information about why doctors chose to treat patients
with Apligraf or TheraSkin. The fact that TheraSkin was used on wounds that had been present
an average of three months longer suggests that doctors could have selected TheraSkin for more
serious or persistent wounds, which also could have affected the results. The failure to control
for this potential bias (as well as for numerous others) was a fundamental flaw that undermines
the conclusions of the study.
Second, the Organogenesis Retrospective Study defined wounds as “closed” when they
were still open, as long as the opening was no larger than .25cm2. The advertisement that
Defendant created discussing the study similarly, and prominently, uses the word “closed”
without disclosing the arbitrary definition used in the Study or that the Organogenesis Pivotal
Trial used a different, widely accepted, definition.
Third, the Organogenesis Retrospective Study failed to account for underlying
comorbidities of the patients. That is, it did not consider whether some of the patients had other
medical conditions that would make wounds heal more slowly or to attempt to control for this
factor.
Fourth, Apligraf was applied far more frequently than TheraSkin in the Organogenesis
Retrospective Study. The Study states that patients using Apligraf required multiple applications
of the product significantly more often than the patients using TheraSkin. In other words,
Apligraf may have appeared to be more effective, but only because far more of it was used. The
Study made no attempt to control for this difference.

Case 4:18-cv-00030-HCM-RJK Document 11 Filed 05/24/18 Page 6 of 32 PageID# 74

Fifth, the authors of the Organogenesis Retrospective Study state that the supposedly
more rapid healing with Apligraf suggests that Apligraf would be cheaper to use, but in reaching
this conclusion they completely fail to take into account the fact that Apligraf required more
applications than TheraSkin.
In addition, the Organogenesis Retrospective Study contains a variety of false statements
and negative implications about TheraSkin. First, it implies that only Apligraf is regulated by
FDA, stating:
Apligraf . . . is a bioengineered living cell therapy that contains human neonatal
keratinocytes and fibroblasts in an extracellular matrix (ECM) of bovine, human
collagen, and other ECM proteins. It is one of only three skin substitute products
approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a “wound treatment.”
In the United States, wound treatments are approved via the FDA premarket
approval process, which mandates the most rigorous FDA review procedures,
including approval of at least one pivotal clinical trial to support its indication.
[Apligraf] is FDA-approved for the treatment of both diabetic foot ulcers and
VLUs, and currently, it is the only skin substitute approved for the treatment of
VLUs. . . .
Another skin substitute on the market is a cryopreserved cadaveric skin allograft .
. . TheraSkin . . . [TheraSkin] is a human skin allograft harvested from tissue
donors within 24 [hours] of death. It is processed with cleaning, hair removal, and
meshing, and then exposed to antibiotics and reagents. The tissue is cryopreserved
in an effort to retain the living cellular and extracellular components. [TheraSkin]
is marketed under Section 361 of the Public Health Services (PHS) Act as Human
Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-based Products (361 HCT/Ps). Under this
regulatory pathway, [TheraSkin] is considered a “wound covering” and adheres
to the standards set forth for the tissue bank industry. Furthermore, clinical
data establishing efficacy or safety are not required.

and Cryopreserved Cadaveric Skin Allograft for the Treatment of Venous Leg Ulcers

to Complaint) (emphasis added).

-5-

Case 4:18-cv-00030-HCM-RJK Document 11 Filed 05/24/18 Page 7 of 32 PageID# 75

In reality, both Apligraf and TheraSkin are subject to stringent FDA requirements that are
tailored to their respective properties and methods of manufacture. Unlike TheraSkin, which is a
minimally manipulated human tissue-based product (see 21 CFR Part 1271), Apligraf is an
extensively processed medical device that incorporates both human and non-human cellular and
non-cellular components. Summary of Safety and Effectiveness Data for Apligraf™ (Graftskin)
(P950032), available at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf/P950032B.pdf
The FDA imposes more restrictions on the sale and distribution of Apligraf than on the
sale and distribution of TheraSkin because Apligraf is classified as a high-risk medical device.
See 21 USC 360c (a) (C) and 21 USC 360e. Thus, the implication in the study that Apligraf is
safer and/or more clinically effective for the treatment of wounds because it has more FDA
oversight is plainly false.
Second, as can be seen in the passage quoted above, the Organogenesis Retrospective
Study falsely characterizes TheraSkin as a “wound covering” (in contrast to a wound treatment)
implying that TheraSkin, unlike Apligraf, does not have therapeutic effect. In fact, pursuant to
applicable FDA regulations, TheraSkin is intended to perform any “homologous use,” i.e., any
use that it would perform in its native state, including, in the case of human skin, wound healing.
The Organogenesis Retrospective Study also erroneously implies that the quality of
TheraSkin will vary based on the differences in the donors from whom the tissue was derived,
and that such variation will adversely affect TheraSkin’s therapeutic capacity, stating:
As a bioengineered product, the cells in [Apligraf] are well characterized for
purity and potency, and manufactured to ensure lot-to-lot consistency. As a
donated tissue product, [TheraSkin] contains the native cells from human skin but
the properties of the tissue will be variable from donor-to-donor and depend on
donor age, health, and location of harvested tissue.

Treadwell, T., et al. at 70. In reality, there are strict screening criteria used to minimize variation
between sources of the tissue used to manufacture TheraSkin, including procuring of tissue from
specific areas of the body and excluding donors based on age or health conditions.
Defendant’s False Advertisement
After completing the highly flawed Organogenesis Retrospective Study, Organogenesis
created an advertisement (the “Advertisement”) and marketing campaign that not only
summarized the false conclusions of that study, but also added additional false information to it.
The Advertisement (which is attached to the Complaint as Exhibit 1) incorporated a
linked copy of the Organogenesis Retrospective Study. It was widely disseminated via e-mail
blasts to hospitals, wound care clinics, health care providers, and other customers for the purpose
of influencing their purchasing decisions.
Defendants refer to the Advertisement as a “Cover E-mail,” but that is deceptive because
the Advertisement did not simply say, “see attached.” Rather, it was formatted as a marketing
piece and contained assertions and charts that were not part of the Study and that were not
actually supported by the Study.
First, the subject heading on the email sending the Advertisement states:
How to Heal More VLUs, Faster
This is a false and deceptive statement because it implies that Apligraf heals wounds more
quickly than TheraSkin. But this is not what the Study measured since it did not compare the
time to wound closure after treatment with each product, but rather the time to achieve a wound
of a specific, arbitrarily-selected size.

-7-

Case 4:18-cv-00030-HCM-RJK Document 11 Filed 05/24/18 Page 9 of 32 PageID# 77

Second, the Advertisement states:
Apligraf® Does It Again!
Similar to Apligraf’s VLU pivotal trial,
APLIGRAF CLOSES MORE VLUs, FASTER
IN A COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS STUDY
Apligraf Closes More VLUs, Faster Compared to TheraSkin®
Read together, these statements clearly imply that Apligraf was shown to be more clinically
effective than TheraSkin not only in the current study, but also in the Pivotal Trial, meaning the
one that supported FDA approval. In fact, it suggests that FDA’s decision to approve Apligraf
was based on data comparing Apligraf to TheraSkin. As discussed above, this is untrue. There
was no previous trial that found Apligraf superior to TheraSkin and the Organogenesis Pivotal
Trial did not involve a comparison to TheraSkin.
In addition, these statements imply that the current Study was a confirmatory clinical trial
conducted in the same manner, and with the same protocols (and FDA stamp of approval) to
control for bias as the initial pivotal trial. This is simply false.
Third, the Advertisement contains three charts with the following headings:
Apligraf closed more VLUs by week 12
Apligraf closed more VLUs by week 24
Apligraf closed more VLUs faster
These assertions are all unsupported by the Study because, as discussed above, the Study was
flawed, rendering its conclusions unsupported, and the Study did not actually study the “closure”
of VLUs.

-8-

Case 4:18-cv-00030-HCM-RJK Document 11 Filed 05/24/18 Page 10 of 32 PageID# 78

Fourth, the Advertisement states:
Apply Apligraf to stimulate healing and close more VLUs, faster
Again, nothing in the Study supports the claim that Apligraf will “close more VLUs, faster,”
because the Study was flawed, and because it did not compare the time it took for the VLUs to
fully “close.”
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
The Study and Advertisement Are Commercial Speech
The Lanham Act prohibits false or misleading representations of fact in commercial
advertising. To fall within the definition of “commercial advertising,” a representation must,
among other things, be “commercial speech.” In determining whether a message is “commercial
speech,” the Fourth Circuit considers whether it: (1) is economically motivated; (2) promotes a
specific product; (3) is an advertisement; and (4) was placed in a commercial context and
directed at the providing of services rather than toward an exchange of ideas. A for-profit
company is generally presumed to have primarily economic motivations for its speech, even
when that speech addresses issues of public concern.
In the present case, Defendant funded a highly flawed study to compare its product to that
of its competitor. Defendant then sent the Study, and an Advertisement inaccurately describing
its results, to numerous customers in an effort to get them to buy Defendant’s product instead of
Plaintiff’s. Under these circumstances, the distribution of the Study and Advertisement was
clearly commercial speech.
Publication in a Journal Does Not Immunize Defendant’s Activities
Defendant argues that, even if the Study and Advertisement are commercial speech,
because the Study was published in a peer reviewed journal, the Study, its distribution, and the
distribution of the Advertisement based on that Study are all protected by the First Amendment

-9-

Case 4:18-cv-00030-HCM-RJK Document 11 Filed 05/24/18 Page 11 of 32 PageID# 79

and, as a result, are beyond the reach of a false advertising claim under the Lanham Act. But the
case law does not support such an expansive reading of the First Amendment’s protection of
advertising in Lanham Act cases.
Numerous courts have held that advertisements are not immune from the reach of the
Lanham Act simply because they are based on peer reviewed studies. Moreover, some have
concluded that even if the initial publication of a peer reviewed study is beyond the reach of the
Lanham Act, its redistribution is not. Furthermore, the courts have been particularly reluctant to
give any protection to advertisements that, like the Advertisement at issue in the present case,
misrepresent the conclusions of peer reviewed studies.
Peer Review Should Not Shield Advertising Campaigns
Defendant’s position that any advertising campaign based on a peer reviewed study
should enjoy blanket immunity from claims for false advertising under the Lanham Act is not
only contrary to the case law but also highly problematic from a public policy perspective. While
peer review may have once been a more or less adequate process to ensure that studies were not
published unless they adhered to basic scientific standards, this is no longer the case.
Many so called “predatory journals” hold themselves out as having a rigorous peer
review process but will actually publish virtually anything as long as the authors pay a
publication fee. But these journals are not readily distinguishable from more legitimate journals.
And even in legitimate journals, the peer review process is sometimes corrupted, with authors
using pseudonyms to serve as their own reviewers or repeatedly reviewing one another’s works.
Because the peer review process lacks transparency even at legitimate journals, problems like
this are difficult or impossible for even a discerning reader to detect.

Case 4:18-cv-00030-HCM-RJK Document 11 Filed 05/24/18 Page 12 of 32 PageID# 80

These concerns about the integrity of the peer review process highlight the problem that
could be created by adopting the approach that Defendant advocates. Under that approach, a
corporation could evade liability for false advertising by commissioning a flawed research study,
having it published in a “peer reviewed” journal that did not subject it to actual review, and then
basing its advertising campaign on the supposed findings of that study. Such a result is neither
desirable nor mandated by the First Amendment.
The Study and Advertisement Were Literally False
To prevail on a false advertising claim under the Lanham Act, a plaintiff must show
either that a statement is “literally false” or that it is likely to mislead and confuse consumers. A
literally false statement can be explicitly false on its face, or false by “necessary implication.” A
plaintiff’s burden in establishing that a statement is literally false varies depending on whether
the statement was an “establishment claim.” An establishment claim is one in which a defendant
claims that a scientific study “establishes” something about a product. In such a case, a plaintiff
does not have to prove that the defendant’s claim about the product is false, but only that the
tests or studies relied upon are not sufficiently reliable to permit one to conclude with reasonable
certainty that they established the claim made. In the present case, Plaintiff has adequately
alleged that the Advertisement contains explicitly false statements and statements that are false
by implication. Furthermore, because Plaintiff has adequately alleged that the Study does not
support the conclusions in either the Study itself or the Advertisement, Plaintiff has met its
burden of alleging that the Defendant’s comparative claims are literally false.
Consumer Deception is Presumed
Evidence of consumer deception is not required when the claims made by a defendant are
literally false. In those cases, consumer deception is presumed. Defendant argues that the

- 11 -

Case 4:18-cv-00030-HCM-RJK Document 11 Filed 05/24/18 Page 13 of 32 PageID# 81

physicians who received Defendant’s Advertisement were too sophisticated to be deceived, but a
district court has recently rejected this exact argument, holding that a “manufacturer’s selective
promotion of favorable scientific information could be potentially misleading even to
sophisticated and experienced doctors” and that the plaintiff was entitled to a presumption of
consumer deception because the statements were literally false. Similarly, in the present case, the
statements at issue are literally false and consumer deception should therefore be presumed.
Plaintiff Adequately Alleges the Elements of the Virginia Law
Plaintiff has also adequately alleged a claim of false advertising under the Virginia Code.
Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not adequately alleged that it suffered an actual loss as a
result of Defendant’s conduct. But that argument simply ignores the various allegations
throughout the Complaint alleging loss of reputation, goodwill and customers as a result of
Defendant’s unlawful conduct.
Retraction of the Advertisement is an Appropriate Remedy
Finally, Defendant argues that an order requiring it engage in corrective advertising has
no support in law. But the Fourth Circuit recently upheld a district court order imposing just such
relief. The court held that “prior restraints prohibiting false and misleading commercial speech
are constitutional” and that the First Amendment “allows the district court to require [the
defendant] to issue a retraction email.”
Defendant’s Motion Should be Denied
For all of these reasons, Defendant’s motion should be denied.

ARGUMENT
I.

DISSEMINATION OF THE STUDY AND ADVERTISEMENT WAS
COMMERCIAL SPEECH.
A. The Study and Advertisement Fall Within the Definition of Commercial
Speech.
The Lanham Act “prohibits false or misleading facts, or representations of fact, ‘in

commercial advertising or promotion’ that misrepresent the quality of another person’s goods.’”
Handsome Brook Farm, LLC v. Humane Farm Animal Care, Inc., 700 F. App’x 251, 255 (4th
Cir. 2017) (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1)(B)) (emphasis added). The Fourth Circuit has held
that to constitute “commercial advertising or promotion” a representation must be: (1)
commercial speech; (2) made for the purpose of influencing consumers to buy goods or services;
and (3) sufficiently disseminated to the relevant purchasing public to constitute advertising or
promotion within that industry. Handsome Brook Farm, 700 F. App’x at 257 (citing Gordon &
Breach Sci. Publishers v. Am. Inst. of Physics, 859 F. Supp. 1521, 1536 (S.D.N.Y. 1994))
(emphasis added).
In determining whether a message is “commercial speech,” the Fourth Circuit considers
whether it: (1) is economically motivated; (2) promotes a specific product; (3) is an
advertisement; and (4) was placed in a commercial context and directed at the providing of
services rather than toward an exchange of ideas. Handsome Brook Farm, 700 F. App’x at 25758. The first prong asks whether the party “hoped to realize an economic gain when
disseminating its message.” Id. at 258. A for-profit company is generally presumed to have
primarily economic motivations for its speech, even when that speech addresses issues of public
concern. See id. Thus, for instance, “an educational seminar hosted by a corporation that sells
houseware, where attendees both may purchase the products and learn ‘how to be financially
responsible and how to run an efficient home,’ is still treated as commercial speech.” Id. at 261

- 13 -

Case 4:18-cv-00030-HCM-RJK Document 11 Filed 05/24/18 Page 15 of 32 PageID# 83

(quoting Bd. of Trustees of State Univ. of N.Y. v. Fox, 492 U.S. 469, 473-74, 109 S. Ct. 3028, 106
L. Ed. 2d 388 (1989)).
Here, Organogenesis funded a highly flawed study to compare its skin substitute,
Apligraf, with that of its competitor. All of the researchers were affiliated with Organogenesis.
The Study was then circulated, together with an accompanying Advertisement that inaccurately
described the results of the Study, to numerous customers and potential customers in an attempt
to increase sales of Apligraf. Under these circumstances, there can be no question that circulation
of the Study and Advertisement were commercial speech made for the purpose of influencing
consumers to buy goods and that they were sufficiently disseminated to the relevant purchasing
public to constitute advertising or promotion within that industry. See Handsome Brook Farm,
700 F. App’x at 262 (finding that an email sent to thirty-six retailers was sufficiently
disseminated to be an attempt to penetrate the relevant market).
B. Defendant’s Activities Are Not Immunized From Lanham Act Liability by
the Fact That the Study Was Published in a Peer Reviewed Journal.
Defendant relies heavily on the Second Circuit case ONY, Inc. v. Cornerstone
Therapeutics, Inc., 720 F.3d 490 (2d Cir. 2013) to argue that its conduct is beyond the reach of
the Lanham Act. In ONY, the court held that the contents of a peer reviewed article were not
subject to a claim for false advertising under the Lanham Act. The court also held that the
secondary distribution of promotional materials that accurately described the conclusions of the
article could not form the basis of a claim for tortious interference.
The ONY case did not address whether secondary distribution of a peer reviewed study
for commercial purposes could form the basis of liability under the Lanham Act (as opposed to a
tortious interference theory of liability). Moreover, the case has been criticized for providing too
much protection for the secondary distribution of study findings. See Recent Cases, 127 Harv. L.

- 14 -

Case 4:18-cv-00030-HCM-RJK Document 11 Filed 05/24/18 Page 16 of 32 PageID# 84

Rev. 1815, 1819 (2014) (“[T]he court did not recognize that dissemination of the published
article for marketing purposes should be considered separately as a secondary act of speech that
may provide a basis for liability under the Lanham Act. Given the ongoing debate on the
reliability of corporate-funded studies, especially in the pharmaceutical industry, the court may
have provided a shield of superficially scientific speech behind which unscrupulous corporations
may hide.”).
Moreover, ONY limited protection for the secondary distribution (in the context of the
tortious interference claim) to situations in which materials distributed accurately described the
conclusions of the study. ONY, 720 F.3d at 499. In the present case, Plaintiff alleges that the
Advertisement did not accurately reflect the conclusions of the Study. See Compl. ¶¶ 30-47.
Notably, other Lanham Act cases have taken a more limited view of the protection
provided by the First Amendment to the distribution of published studies and promotional
materials based on those studies. For instance, in Eastman Chem. Co. v. PlastiPure, Inc., 775
F.3d 230 (5th Cir. 2014), the Fifth Circuit held that advertisements based on a peer reviewed
study fell within the reach of the Lanham Act. The court distinguished ONY, stating:
The plaintiff in ONY sought to enjoin statements made within the academic
literature and directed at the scientific community. In that context, the Second
Circuit concluded that the defendants’ statements should be treated as opinions,
else the prospect of defamation liability would stifle academic debate and trench
upon First Amendment values. . . . Here, in contrast, Eastman did not sue
Appellants for publishing an article in a scientific journal. Rather, Eastman sought
to enjoin statements made in commercial advertisements and directed at
customers. . . . In this commercial context, the First Amendment is no obstacle to
enforcement of the Lanham Act.
Id. at 236.
The court went on to note that the advertisements at issue were not immune from the
Lanham Act simply because they were based on a peer reviewed study, stating:

- 15 -

Case 4:18-cv-00030-HCM-RJK Document 11 Filed 05/24/18 Page 17 of 32 PageID# 85

[I]t is of no moment that the commercial speech in this case concerned a topic of
scientific debate. Advertisements do not become immune from Lanham Act
scrutiny simply because their claims are open to scientific or public debate.
Otherwise, the Lanham Act would hardly ever be enforceable—”many, if not
most, products may be tied to public concerns with the environment, energy,
economic policy, or individual health and safety.” Cent. Hudson, 447 U.S. at 563
n.5. The Supreme Court has “made clear that advertising which links a product to
a current public debate is not thereby entitled to the constitutional protection
afforded noncommercial speech.” Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463
U.S. 60, 68, 103 S. Ct. 2875, 77 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1983) (internal quotation marks
omitted); see also Recent Case, 127 Harv. L. Rev. 1815, 1819 (2014)
(“Dissemination of a scientific article as part of a company’s marketing campaign
is for promotional purposes and therefore qualifies as commercial speech.”).
Id. at 236-37.
Similarly, in Mimedx Grp., Inc. v. Osiris Therapeutics, Inc., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
114105 (S.D.N.Y. July 21, 2017) the court concluded that a press release and brochure
summarizing the results of a peer reviewed study were commercial speech, and subject to the
Lanham Act, despite the fact they addressed topics of scientific debate, stating:
“Pure commercial speech ‘does no more than propose a commercial transaction.’“
Enigma Software Grp. USA, 194 F. Supp. 3d at 293-94 (quoting Bolger v. Youngs
Drug Prods. Corp., 463 U.S. 60, 66, 103 S. Ct. 2875, 77 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1983)).
Meanwhile, “a ‘hybrid’ communication, i.e., one that combines commercial and
non-commercial elements, may nonetheless be ‘commercial’ where [i] it is an
advertisement; [ii] it refers to a specific product or service; and [iii] the speaker
has an economic motivation for the speech.” Id.; see Bolger, 463 U.S. at 66-67
(holding that pamphlets containing information about sexually transmitted disease
were “properly characterized as commercial speech,” despite their discussion of
important social issues, because they were advertisements that referenced the
publisher’s products and the publisher had a commercial motivation for
disseminating them).
Here, the statements in the Press Release and the Brochure qualify as
commercial speech: They tout the benefits of Defendant’s product over Plaintiff’s
competing product and they are principally directed to a consumer audience, not a
scientific one. Contrary to Defendant’s assurance, ONY does not alter the calculus

Case 4:18-cv-00030-HCM-RJK Document 11 Filed 05/24/18 Page 18 of 32 PageID# 86

In Biolase, Inc. v. Fotona Proizvodnja Optoelektronskih Naprav D. D., 2014 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 195010 (C.D. Cal. 2014) (June 4, 2104), a court addressing this issue focused on whether
the plaintiff had alleged that the secondary materials accurately reflected the findings of the
study. There, the plaintiff alleged that its competitor had used false and misleading advertising
and that the journal article on which the advertising was based was flawed. The court, citing
ONY, initially dismissed plaintiff’s complaint. Id. However, when the plaintiff subsequently filed
an amended complaint alleging that the conclusions in the article did not support the claims
made in the advertisements, the court held that the plaintiff had adequately stated a claim for
false advertising, noting that in ONY, the alleged false advertising appeared to be “accurate
restatements” of conclusions in scientific journal articles. Id.
In Gordon & Breach Sci. Publrs. S.A. v. Am. Inst. of Physics, 859 F. Supp. 1521
(S.D.N.Y. 1994), the court held that distribution of articles can constitute “commercial speech”
even when the articles themselves are not commercial speech. There, the court stated:
While we have held that non-profit organizations must be free to publish on any
topic, even those that redound to their financial benefit, without fear of Lanham
Act liability, the same does not apply to subsequent (or, occasionally, prior)
promotional uses of that speech. The situation is similar to that of a restaurant or
movie review or a Consumer Reports product report. While the restaurant review
or product report itself constitutes exactly the type of “consumer or editorial
comment” that “raise[s] free speech concerns” and which Congress explicitly
intended to exclude from Section 43(a)’s scope, see supra p. 28, a restaurant
clearly engages in commercial speech when it posts the New York Times review
in its window, and General Motors engages in commercial speech when it
announces in a television commercial that its car was ranked first by Consumer
Reports. The Consumer Reports article, of course, does not somehow become
commercial speech; rather, G.M.’s use of the article is commercial speech.
Consequently, G.M. may be sued under the Lanham Act, and Consumer Reports’
testing methodology may become subject to judicial scrutiny to determine
whether G.M. “used in commerce” a “false or misleading representation of fact.”
We do not reach a different conclusion here merely because the secondary user of
the articles is the same entity that published them in the first place.
Id. at 1544-45.

Similarly, in Bracco Diagnostics, Inc. v. Amersham Health, Inc., 627 F. Supp. 2d 384
(D.N.J. 2009), the court held that although the publication of a peer-reviewed scientific article
did not constitute commercial speech, the secondary dissemination of the article itself in a press
release did constitute commercial speech. The court stated:
Accordingly, because GEH’s advertising campaign using the NEPHRIC article is
clearly promotional in nature, similar to the advertising in [Gordon & Breach
Science Publishers v. Am. Inst. of Physics, 859 F. Supp. 1521, 1537 (S.D.N.Y.
1994)] and [Washington Legal Found. v. Friedman, 13 F. Supp. 2d 51 (D.D.C.
1998), vacated in part on other grounds 340 U.S. App. D.C. 108, 202 F.3d 331
(D.C. Cir. 2000)], the Court finds that Defendants’ secondary distribution of the
NEPHRIC article does constitute a form of commercial speech.
Id. at 459 (emphasis added).
A similar issue arose in Semco, Inc. v. Amcast, Inc., 52 F.3d 108 (6th Cir. 1995). There,
the president of Amcast submitted an article for publication in a trade journal. After the article
was published, Amcast obtained reprints, made numerous copies, and used the article as a
promotional brochure at trade shows. Addressing the question of whether the article was
commercial speech for purposes of a Lanham Act claim, the court noted initially that: “Speech
need not closely resemble a typical advertisement to be commercial.” Id. at 112. The court
further stated that: “The district court in this case viewed the Kopp article as more article than
advertisement, but we cannot ignore the promotions of Amcast, also evident in the article, which
do not contribute to its intellectual or technical value.” Thus, the court concluded that “the
alleged misrepresentations contained in the Kopp article represent commercial speech and are
actionable under the Lanham Act.” Id. at 114 (emphasis added).
In Genzyme Corp. v. Shire Human Genetic Therapies, Inc., 906 F. Supp. 2d 9 (D. Mass.
2012) the court held that a press release describing a comparative study was commercial speech,
stating:

- 18 -

Case 4:18-cv-00030-HCM-RJK Document 11 Filed 05/24/18 Page 20 of 32 PageID# 88

In this case, while the original presentation of the comparative data at the
EWGGD convocation was protected scientific expression, its secondary
dissemination in a press release by Shire HGT was not. The press release was
not a scientific publication, it directly named VPRIV and Genzyme, the two
principal competitors in the Gaucher disease enzyme replacement therapy market,
and it listed Shire plc’s stock symbols on its first line. See United States v.
Harkonen, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47255, 2009 WL 1578712, at *6 (N.D. Cal.
June 4, 2009) (“That the speech is a press release and not a peer-reviewed
publication, that it refers to a specific commercial product on the market . . ., and
that it was unquestionably disseminated for commercial benefit (e.g., the first line
notes [defendant]’s Nasdaq stock symbol), are allegations that take the speech at
issue outside the realm of pure science speech and move it towards the realm of
commercial speech.”). Like the promotional speech in Gordon & Breach and
Bracco, the press release selectively disseminated information favorable to Shire
HGT’s VPRIV and unflattering to Genzyme to an audience that included both
physicians who prescribe Gaucher disease treatments and patients (e.g., those
served by the National Gaucher Foundation) who might request a specific
treatment. Under the circumstances, Shire HGT’s press release may be deemed
commercial speech.
Id. at 16-17 (emphasis added).
Further, the court held that because determining whether the press release contained false
statements would require “delving into murky scientific data and analysis” from the underlying
study, resolution on a motion to dismiss was inappropriate. The court explained:
Shire HGT’s fallback argument is that even if the press release constituted
commercial speech, Genzyme’s Verified Complaint fails to allege that it
contained literally false statements, impliedly false or misleading statements, or
embellished claims, because the press release accurately reported the underlying
scientific analysis and results. Unless the complained of speech is such that “a
court can properly say that no reasonable person could be misled by the
advertisement in question,” Pernod Ricard USA, LLC v. Bacardi U.S.A., Inc.,
653 F.3d 241, 252 (3rd Cir. 2011), “it is not appropriate to resolve [the issue of
the truthfulness of the speech] on a motion to dismiss.” World Wrestling Fed’n
Entm’t, Inc. v. Bozell, 142 F. Supp. 2d. 514, 529 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). In Pernod, the
court found that despite the prominent mark “Havana Club,” Bacardi’s rum labels
were not misleading because they clearly stated that the product was “Puerto
Rican Rum” that was “distilled and crafted in Puerto Rico.” Pernod, 653 F.3d at
252. In contrast, Genzyme alleges that the press release conveyed the literally
false message that VPRIV outperforms Genzyme in improving patient BMD.
VC ¶ 28. Unlike the clear picture in Pernod, the veracity of this allegation
involves a delving into murky scientific data and analysis, a task that cannot be

Case 4:18-cv-00030-HCM-RJK Document 11 Filed 05/24/18 Page 21 of 32 PageID# 89

satisfactorily undertaken on a motion to dismiss where the court is largely
confined to the allegations of the complaint.
Id. at 17 (emphasis added).
Defendant starts off its brief with a quote from Underwager v. Salter, 22 F.3d 730 (7th
Cir. 1994), but that case is not a Lanham Act case and is not comparable to the present case.
Underwager was a defamation case brought under Wisconsin law by two psychologists who had
written books concluding that most accusations of child sexual abuse stem from false memories.
One of the plaintiffs routinely served as an expert witness for defendants accused of molesting
children. One of the defendants was a psychologist who had given a television interview
criticizing the plaintiffs’ books and who, using funding from a grant, had drafted an unpublished
monograph on the same topic. The other defendant was a former prosecutor who played a tape of
the television interview at conferences for prosecutors in child sexual abuse cases.
The plaintiffs in Underwager argued that, to prevail on their defamation claim, they did
not need to establish “actual malice” (which, the court noted, has nothing to do with “ill will,”
but rather, means “knowledge that the statement was false, or doubts about its truth coupled with
reckless disregard of whether it was false”) because defendants were not reporters or publishers.
The court disagreed, noting that “[p]sychologists compiling monographs with the aid of research
grants, and prosecutors seeking to augment one side’s arsenal for trial” do not have the financial
resources of newspapers and broadcast stations and that “[e]xposing such persons to large
awards of damages is more apt to lead to silence than are comparable awards against media
defendants.” Thus, the court concluded that the plaintiffs could prevail only if they could show
that defendants acted with actual malice.

- 20 -

Case 4:18-cv-00030-HCM-RJK Document 11 Filed 05/24/18 Page 22 of 32 PageID# 90

Finding that the defendants acted without malice, the court affirmed the lower court’s
grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants. The court stated (immediately prior to the
passage quoted by Defendants in the present case):
Both [of the defendants] came to believe that [the plaintiff who serves as an
expert witness] is a hired gun who makes a living by deceiving judges about the
state of medical knowledge and thus assisting child molesters to evade
punishment. Persons who hold such opinions cannot be expected to look kindly
on their subjects, and the law certainly does not insist that they shut up as soon as
they are challenged. [The plaintiffs] cannot, simply by filing suit and crying
“character assassination!”, silence those who hold divergent views, no matter how
adverse those views may be to plaintiffs’ interests.
Id. at 736 (citation omitted).
Underwager is not equivalent to the present case. In that case, the defendants did not seek
to sell a product. Rather, they sought to help train prosecutors by explaining the problems that
they saw with the research underlying the plaintiffs’ books and testimony. Moreover,
Underwager dealt with individuals with limited funding who were likely to be silenced by the
prospect of large damages awards.
In contrast, Defendant in the present case is a corporation that undertook a flawed
research study that yielded invalid results, misrepresented the Study’s conclusions in an
advertisement, and then widely disseminated the article and advertisement in an effort to get
purchasers to buy its product rather than a competitor’s product. Defendant’s actions are
commercial speech and are well within the reach of the Lanham Act’s prohibition on false
advertising.
C. Immunizing Advertisements That Are Based on Peer Reviewed Studies
Would Create a Massive Loophole in the Lanham Act’s Prohibition on
False Advertising.
Defendant argues that any advertising campaign based on a peer reviewed study should
be immune from claims for false advertising under the Lanham Act even if the claims made in

- 21 -

Case 4:18-cv-00030-HCM-RJK Document 11 Filed 05/24/18 Page 23 of 32 PageID# 91

the study and advertisements are completely false. They hypothesize a world in which ideas can
be fought with more ideas and the courts can depend on the peer review process to guarantee that
basic scientific standards are followed and that truly bad research isn’t published. But if such a
world ever existed, it no longer does.
In reality, while some peer reviewed journals do impose legitimate controls on what gets
published, many others will publish virtually any article as long as the authors pay a fee. An
article discussing this problem noted that a spoof paper was recently accepted into an ostensibly
peer reviewed journal despite the fact that the paper “was a simple repetition of the words ‘Get
me off your f***ing mailing list’ for 10 pages, complete with section headings and appropriate
figures.” Bonnie Swoger, Is this peer reviewed? Predatory journals and the transparency of peer
review.” Scientific American (Nov. 26, 2014) (providing link to spoof paper).1 “The paper was
accepted by the International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology, which promotes its
tiered and highly selective review process on its website.” Id.
The Scientific American article goes on to explain:
Journals like IJACT are often called “predatory journals,” journals that accept
anything, as long as you are willing to pay the publication fee. . . . [T]o a novice, a
journal like IJACT looks a lot like other scientific journals . . . Predatory
publishers can get away with claiming a rigorous review process because
traditional peer review is shrouded in secrecy. The reader sees the same amount of
evidence about the peer review process from both high quality journals and
predatory journals: a statement about the process on their website. . . . A skeptical
reader might try to find out more about the journal: where is it indexed, what
metrics are associated with it, who is on the editorial board? But a typical user
won’t go through all of this effort and [will] accept the piece at face value. And
even a skeptical reader would find it impossible (at most journals) to understand
the peer review standards employed or the criteria reviewers use: this information
is rarely available to users.

Id.
Even in legitimate journals, peer review does not always operate as one might expect.
Many journals allow authors to recommend independent reviewers, which can obviously
compromise the objectivity of the process. C. Ferguson, A. Marcus & I. Oransky Publishing:
The peer-review scam; When a handful of authors were caught reviewing their own papers, it
exposed weaknesses in modern publishing systems. Editors are trying to plug the holes. Nature,
November 26, 2014.2 Moreover, there have been a number of instances of massive peer review
rigging, in which authors reviewed their own papers using pseudonyms or reviewed one
another’s works as part of a “peer review ring.” Id.
Given these concerns about the integrity of the peer review process, as well as “the
ongoing debate on the reliability of corporate-funded studies, especially in the pharmaceutical
industry,” granting blanket immunity to any advertisement that is based on the findings of a peer
reviewed article would raise grave concerns as it could provide “a shield of superficially
scientific speech behind which unscrupulous corporations may hide.” See Recent Cases, 127
Harv. L. Rev. 1815, 1819 (2014).
Under this scenario any corporation could immunize a dishonest marketing campaign
simply by commissioning a misleading research study and paying a fee to have it published in a
dubious “peer reviewed” journal. Such a result is neither desirable nor mandated under the First
Amendment.
II.

THE STUDY AND ADVERTISEMENT WERE LITERALLY FALSE.
A Lanham Act plaintiff can prevail on a false advertising claim either by showing that a

statement is “literally false,” or by showing that, although literally true, it is likely to mislead and

to confuse consumers given the merchandising context. First Data Merch. Servs. Corp. v.
SecurityMetrics, Inc., 672 F. App’x 229, 234 (4th Cir. 2016) (“A plaintiff can establish the first
element by showing an advertisement is either (a) literally false or (b) literally true but likely to
mislead or confuse consumers.”) (citing C.B. Fleet Co. v. SmithKline Beecham Consumer
Healthcare, L.P., 131 F.3d 430, 434 (4th Cir. 1997)); PBM Prods., LLC v. Mead Johnson & Co.,
639 F.3d 111, 120 (4th Cir. 2011).
A literally false message may be conveyed explicitly or by “necessary implication” when,
considering the advertisement in its entirety, the audience would recognize the claim as readily
as if it had been explicitly stated. PBM Prods., 639 F.3d at 120 (quoting Scotts Co. v. United
Indus. Corp., 315 F.3d 264, 274 (4th Cir 2002)). Thus, “a claim of literal falsity by necessary
implication is viable where the plaintiff’s asserted conclusion ‘necessarily flowed from the ad’s
statements.’” Trex Co. v. CPG Int’l LLC, Civil Action No. 5:17-cv-00005, 2017 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 120317, at *24-29 (W.D. Va. Aug. 1, 2017) (quoting Design Resources, Inc. v. Leather
Indus. of Am., 789 F.3d 495, 503 (4th Cir. 2015).
In articulating a plaintiff’s burden in establishing that a claim is literally false, courts
distinguish between “establishment claims” and “non-establishment claims.” See, e.g., Church &
Dwight Co. v. Clorox Co., 840 F. Supp. 2d 717, 722-23 (S.D.N.Y. 2012). An establishment
claim is one in which the defendant claims that a scientific study “establishes” something about a
product. In a case involving establishment claims, a plaintiff does not have to prove that the
defendant’s claims are false, but only that the tests or studies relied upon “are not sufficiently
reliable to permit one to conclude with reasonable certainty that they established the claim
made.” McNeil-P.C.C., Inc. v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 938 F.2d 1544, 1548-49 (2d Cir. 1991)
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the Fourth Circuit has stated:

- 24 -

Case 4:18-cv-00030-HCM-RJK Document 11 Filed 05/24/18 Page 26 of 32 PageID# 94

When an advertising claim of favorable fact either expressly or impliedly asserts
that the fact is test or study-validated, the fact of the validation becomes an
integral and critical part of the claim. Such a claim may therefore be proven
literally false by showing only that the test asserted to validate it did not in fact do
so.
C.B. Fleet Co. v. SmithKline Beecham Consumer Healthcare, Ltd. P’ship, 131 F.3d 430, 435
(4th Cir. 1997). See also, e.g., Church & Dwight, 840 F. Supp. 2d at 722-23 (“Where, as here,
scientific or technical evidence is said to establish an advertiser’s claim (a so-called
‘establishment claim’), a plaintiff can prove literal falsity by showing that the test ‘did not
establish the proposition for which [it was] cited’ because it is either ‘not sufficiently reliable to
permit a conclusion’ or ‘simply irrelevant.’”); Osmose, Inc. v. Viance, LLC, 612 F.3d 1298, 1310
(11th Cir. 2010) (“Osmose, as a plaintiff challenging “tests prove” or “establishment” claims,
does not have to affirmatively prove that Viance’s safety concerns are false; rather, Osmose has
to prove only that Viance’s tests do not support Viance’s conclusions.”); Alpo Petfoods, Inc. v.
Ralston Purina Co., 720 F. Supp. 194, 213 (D.D.C. 1989) (“representations found to be
unsupported by accepted authority or research or which are contradicted by prevailing authority
or research, may be deemed false on their face and actionable under Section 43(a) of the Lanham
Act.”), aff’d in part, rev’d in part on other grounds, 286 U.S. App. D.C. 192, 913 F.2d 958 (D.C.
Cir. 1990); Procter & Gamble Co. v. Chesebrough-Pond’s Inc., 747 F.2d 114, 119 (2d Cir.
1984) (“To prove such falsity Chesebrough assumed the burden of showing that the tests referred
to by P&G were not sufficiently reliable to permit one to conclude with reasonable certainty that
they established the proposition for which they were cited.”). As the Eighth Circuit has
explained:
False advertising decisions in other circuits have consistently distinguished
between two types of comparative advertising claims: “my product is better than
yours,” versus “tests prove that my product is better than yours.” To successfully
challenge the first type of claim, a Lanham Act plaintiff must prove that

- 25 -

Case 4:18-cv-00030-HCM-RJK Document 11 Filed 05/24/18 Page 27 of 32 PageID# 95

defendant’s claim of superiority is false. But to successfully challenge the second
type of claim, where defendant has hyped the claim of superiority by attributing it
to the results of scientific testing, plaintiff must prove only “that the tests [relied
upon] were not sufficiently reliable to permit one to conclude with reasonable
certainty that they established the proposition for which they were cited.” . . .
Neither party challenges the standard, and we agree it is a correct application of
Lanham Act § 43.
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Pharm., Inc. v. Marion Merrell Dow, Inc., 93 F.3d 511, 514-15 (8th Cir.
1996) (emphasis added). See also BASF Corp. v. Old World Trading Co., 41 F.3d 1081, 1090
(7th Cir. 1994) (“A plaintiff’s burden in proving literal falsity thus varies depending on the
nature of the challenged advertisement. Where the defendant’s advertisement claims that its
product is superior, plaintiff must affirmatively prove defendant’s product equal or inferior.
Where . . . defendant’s ad explicitly or implicitly represents that tests or studies prove its product
superior, plaintiff establishes its burden by showing that the tests did not establish the
proposition for which they were cited.”) (quoting Castrol Inc. v. Quaker State Corp., 977 F.2d
57, 63 (2d Cir. 1992)).
Similarly, the Ninth Circuit has explained that, to prove that an advertising claim is
“literally false,” a plaintiff “must demonstrate that such tests are not sufficiently reliable to
permit one to conclude with reasonable certainty that they established’ the claim made.”
Southland Sod Farms v. Stover Seed Co., 108 F.3d 1134, 1139 (9th Cir. 1997) (citations and
internal quotation marks omitted). A plaintiff “may meet this burden either by attacking the
validity of the defendant’s tests directly or by showing that the defendant’s tests are contradicted
or unsupported by other scientific tests.” Id.
The Complaint sufficiently alleges that certain statements in Defendant’s Advertisement
are explicitly false and false by implication. In addition, the present case involves “establishment
claims.” Defendant’s comparative claims “may therefore be proven literally false by showing

- 26 -

Case 4:18-cv-00030-HCM-RJK Document 11 Filed 05/24/18 Page 28 of 32 PageID# 96

only that the test asserted to validate it did not in fact do so.” C.B. Fleet Co., 131 F.3d at 435.
Because Plaintiff has adequately alleged that the Study does not support the conclusions stated in
the Study itself or in the Advertisement, Plaintiff has met its burden of alleging that the claims
are false.
III.

CONSUMER DECEPTION IS PRESUMED BECAUSE DEFENDANT’S CLAIMS
ARE LITERALLY FALSE.
External evidence of consumer deception is not required when the subject advertisements

contain literally false statements. See In re GNC Corp., 789 F.3d 505, 514 (4th Cir. 2015);
Scotts, 315 F.3d at 273; Handsome Brook Farm, LLC v. Humane Farm Animal Care, Inc., 193 F.
Supp. 3d 556, 572 (E.D. Va. 2016).
In Sanderson Farms, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 547 F. Supp. 2d 491 (D. Md. 2008), the
court stated:
In this case, unlike in Scotts Co., Plaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated
consumer confusion. There are two distinct aspects to this inquiry, each
requiring different quanta of proof: “If the advertising is literally false, no
evidence of consumer confusion is required. But if the advertising is
impliedly false, the plaintiff must present extrinsic evidence of consumer
confusion.” Scotts Co., 315 F.3d at 274.
Plaintiffs have established the literal falsity of Defendant’s unqualified
“Raised Without Antibiotics” claim. . . . Having demonstrated the literal
falsity of the unqualified “Raised Without Antibiotics” claim and having
demonstrated consumer confusion, Plaintiffs have established irreparable
harm as to Defendant’s unqualified “Raised Without Antibiotics” claim.
Id. at 503-05 (emphasis added).
Defendant argues that the “physicians and other clinicians and scientists” who received
the Advertisement are too sophisticated to have been deceived. This precise argument was
rejected in Genzyme Corp., where the defendant argued that the plaintiff had “failed to
sufficiently allege the necessary element of consumer deception because the physicians who
prescribe Gaucher disease treatments are sophisticated experts who are not easily misled.”

- 27 -

Case 4:18-cv-00030-HCM-RJK Document 11 Filed 05/24/18 Page 29 of 32 PageID# 97

Genzyme Corp., 906 F. Supp. at 17. The court rejected this argument, noting that “a
pharmaceutical manufacturer’s selective promotion of favorable scientific information could be
potentially misleading even to sophisticated and experienced doctors.” Id. The court held that the
plaintiff was “entitled to the benefit of a presumption of consumer deception because it has
alleged the dissemination of literally false statements.” Id. at 17-18. Thus, the court held that “all
of the necessary elements of a Lanham Act violation are sufficiently plead[ed],” and denied the
motion to dismiss. Id. at 18.
Here, because the Study and Advertisement contain literally false statements, Plaintiff
need not provide any evidence of consumer deception.
IV.

PLAINTIFF HAS ADEQUATELY ALLEGED A VIOLATION OF VIRGINIA’S
FALSE ADVERTISING LAW.
Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim of false advertising under the

Virginia Code, Section 18.2–216, because it has not adequately alleged that it has suffered any
actual loss as a result of Defendant’s conduct. Defendant states that: “Because Solsys’s naked
assertion that it ‘has been injured and is likely to be further damaged by these continuing
violations of § 18.2–216 (Compl. ¶ 61) is wholly lacking in factual support, this claim should be
dismissed for failure to state a plausible cause of action.”
But while Defendant is correct that § 59.1-68.3 of the Virginia Code requires a
party to have “suffer[ed] a loss” to have standing, Defendant completely disregards the
numerous injuries that Plaintiff alleges in its Complaint, including reputational harm to
Plaintiff and lost sales and profits caused by the falsehoods in (and the circulation of) the
false Advertisement (Complaint ¶¶ 26 – 28, 31 – 32, 53, 55). The allegations that
Defendant’s false Advertisement caused such injuries is clearly sufficient for purposes of
a claim under Virginia Code Section 18.2–216. See Maldonado v. Nutri/System, Inc., 776

- 28 -

Case 4:18-cv-00030-HCM-RJK Document 11 Filed 05/24/18 Page 30 of 32 PageID# 98

F. Supp. 278 (E.D. Va. 1991) (indicating that loss is a generic and relative term which is
synonymous with, or equivalent to, damage, damages . . . [and] injury, and holding that
“loss” encompassed not only economic loss, but also personal injuries.”) (citing Black's
Law Dictionary 851 (5th ed. 1979)).
V.

RETRACTION IS AN APPROPRIATE REMEDY AND DOES NOT VIOLATE
THE FIRST AMENDMENT.
Defendant mischaracterizes Plaintiff’s requested relief. Among other things, Plaintiff

seeks “an order requiring Organogenesis to correct any erroneous impression persons may have
derived concerning the nature, characteristics or qualities of Apligraf including without
limitation the placement of corrective advertising and providing written notice to the public and
a retraction of any references to or any information regarding Organogenesis’ Retrospective
Study.” Compl. at page 15 (emphasis added). Thus, contrary to Defendant’s assertion, Plaintiff
does not seek to have the journal that published the Study retract the Study. Rather, Plaintiff
seeks to have Defendant issue corrective advertising retracting the false claims that it has made.
Contrary to Defendant’s assertion that “compulsory retraction and corrective advertising .
. . has no support in law,” the Fourth Circuit recently imposed precisely this remedy in
Handsome Brook:
The First Amendment also allows the district court to require HFAC to issue a
retraction email. While compelled speech is usually a bold remedy in the context
of noncommercial speech, compelled speech is more likely to be constitutionally
permissible in the context of commercial speech. . . .
Here, compelling HFAC to issue a retraction email is reasonably related to the
State’s interest in preventing deception of consumers. HFAC’s email informed
the grocery stores, who were Handsome Brook’s consumers, that Handsome
Brook’s eggs were not pasture raised or organic. As determined by the district
court and largely uncontested here, this email was likely false or misleading.
Merely refusing to further disseminate the email reduces the speed by which the
false information spreads, but provides no remedy for those who have already
read the email and those who share the email with others. Requiring HFAC to

requirement to ensure that those who received the first email will also receive the
retraction email that mitigates the harm the first email caused.
Requiring HFAC to issue a retraction email thus comports with the First
Amendment. Taking into account the irreparable harm that may occur without the
injunction and the constitutionality of the injunction’s restraints, the balance of
equities counsels in favor of the preliminary injunction.
Handsome Brook Farm, 700 F. App’x at 264 (4th Cir. 2017) (emphasis added).
An order prohibiting Defendant from engaging in further dissemination of its false
statements is also appropriate. As the court stated in Handsome Brook:
[P]rior restraints prohibiting false and misleading commercial speech are
constitutional. See, e.g., Cent. Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Pub. Serv. Comm’n
of N.Y., 447 U.S. 557, 563, 100 S. Ct. 2343, 65 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1980) (“[T]here
can be no constitutional objection to the suppression of commercial messages that
do not accurately inform the public about lawful activity.”). Because, as
determined above, HFAC’s email is likely false or misleading commercial speech,
the district court may prohibit HFAC from disseminating the email.
Handsome Brook Farm, LLC v. Humane Farm Animal Care, Inc., 700 F. App’x 251, 264 (4th
Cir. 2017) (emphasis added).
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, this Court should deny Defendant’s motion to dismiss.
